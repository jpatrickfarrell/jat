Complete current task properly with full verification. Session ends after completion.

# Agent Complete - Finish Task Properly

**Usage:**
- `/jat:complete` - Complete current task with full verification

**What this command does:**
1. **Read & Respond to Agent Mail** (ALWAYS - before completing)
2. **Full Completion Protocol**:
   - Verify task (tests, lint, security, browser checks)
   - Commit changes with proper message
3. **Beads Task Management**:
   - Mark task as complete in Beads (`bd close`)
   - Release file reservations
4. **Announce Completion** in Agent Mail
5. **End Session** - Session is complete, user spawns new agent for next task

**Key behaviors:**
- **ALWAYS check Agent Mail first** - before completing work
- Mail = read + respond + ack (not just silent batch-ack)

**When to use:**
- After you display "🔍 READY FOR REVIEW" and user approves
- Task is complete and ready to close

**When NOT to use:**
- Need to pivot quickly → use `/jat:pause` instead

---

## CRITICAL: "Ready for Review" vs "Complete"

**These are two different states. Never confuse them.**

| State | Meaning | Display | Beads Status |
|-------|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Ready for Review** | Code work done, awaiting user decision | "🔍 READY FOR REVIEW" | `in_progress` |
| **Complete** | Closed in Beads, reservations released | "✅ TASK COMPLETE" | `closed` |

**NEVER say "Task Complete" until AFTER:**
1. Changes committed
2. `bd close` has run successfully
3. Reservations released
4. Completion announced via Agent Mail

**The typical flow:**
1. You finish coding → display "🔍 READY FOR REVIEW"
2. User reviews and runs `/jat:complete`
3. You run completion steps (commit, close, release, announce)
4. THEN display "✅ TASK COMPLETE"

**Why this matters:**
- Other agents check Beads to see if tasks are available
- If you say "complete" but haven't run `bd close`, another agent will see the task as still in-progress
- This causes confusion and coordination problems

## Bash Syntax Patterns for Claude Code

**CRITICAL:** Claude Code's Bash tool escapes command substitution syntax. You MUST use these patterns:

### CORRECT Patterns

**Pattern 1: Use Read/Write tools (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
# Step 1: Get value
~/code/jat/scripts/get-current-session-id
# → "a019c84c-7b54-45cc-9eee-dd6a70dea1a3"

# Step 2: Use Write tool with that value
Write(.claude/agent-a019c84c-7b54-45cc-9eee-dd6a70dea1a3.txt, "AgentName")
```

**Pattern 2: Explicit variable assignment with semicolon**
```bash
# Works: Explicit assignment with semicolon
SESSION_ID="a019c84c-7b54-45cc-9eee-dd6a70dea1a3"; echo "$SESSION_ID"

# Works: Use test command with && / ||
test -f "$file" && echo "exists" || echo "not found"
```

### WRONG Patterns (Will Cause Syntax Errors)

```bash
# BROKEN: Command substitution in assignment
SESSION_ID=$(~/code/jat/scripts/get-current-session-id)
# Error: gets escaped

# BROKEN: if statement with &&
SESSION_ID="abc" && if [[ -f "$file" ]]; then echo "yes"; fi
# Error: syntax error
```

---

## Implementation Steps

### STEP 1: Get Current Task and Agent Identity

#### 1A: Get Session ID
```bash
~/code/jat/scripts/get-current-session-id
# → Extract session_id value
```

#### 1B: Get Agent Name
```bash
# Read .claude/agent-{session_id}.txt
# → Extract agent_name
```

#### 1C: Get Current Task
```bash
# Get task from Beads (in_progress tasks for this agent)
bd list --json | jq -r --arg agent "$agent_name" \
  '.[] | select(.assignee == $agent and .status == "in_progress") | .id' | head -1
```

**Error handling:**
- If no session ID found → error "No active session. Run /jat:start first"
- If no agent name found → error "No agent registered. Run /jat:start first"
- If no in_progress task → **continue to Step 1D** (spontaneous work detection)

---

### STEP 1D: Spontaneous Work Detection (If No Task Found)

**Only execute if Step 1C found no `in_progress` task.**

This step detects ad-hoc work done without a formal Beads task and offers to create a backfilled task record for proper attribution and audit trail.

#### Analyze Conversation Context

Review recent conversation for **completed work signals**:

1. **Work completion phrases:**
   - "I added...", "I fixed...", "I implemented...", "I refactored..."
   - "Built...", "Created...", "Removed...", "Changed...", "Updated..."
   - "Done with...", "Finished...", "Completed..."
   - "The fix...", "The solution...", "Root cause was..."

2. **File/code references:**
   - File paths mentioned in tool calls or discussion
   - Code snippets shared or modified
   - Technical details of implementation

3. **Problem/solution context:**
   - What problem was being solved?
   - What was the approach taken?
   - Any decisions or trade-offs made?

#### Analyze Git State

```bash
# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --porcelain

# Get summary of what changed
git diff --stat

# Recent commits (may include work from this session)
git log --oneline -5
```

#### Synthesize Work Summary

Combine conversation signals + git state to infer:
- **Title**: Verb + noun describing the work (e.g., "Fix jat CLI -p flag causing non-interactive sessions")
- **Type**: `bug`, `feature`, `task`, or `chore` based on nature of work
- **Description**: What was done and why
- **Files touched**: From git diff + conversation context

#### Present Proposal

**If work detected**, display proposal and ask for confirmation:

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║         🔍 SPONTANEOUS WORK DETECTED                   ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

No formal task was in progress, but work was detected:

📋 Proposed Task:
   Title: [inferred title]
   Type: [task/bug/feature/chore]
   Description: [inferred description]

📁 Files Changed: [list from git status/diff]

Create a backfilled task record? [Proceed? Y/n]
```

#### If User Confirms

```bash
# Create the backfilled task (already in_progress since work is done)
bd create "[title]" \
  --type [type] \
  --description "[description]" \
  --assignee "$agent_name" \
  --status in_progress

# Extract task_id from output
# Set $task_id and $task_title variables
# Continue to Step 2 (Read & Respond to Mail)
```

#### If User Declines

```
Understood. No task record created.

Options:
  • /jat:start - Pick up a new task
  • bd create "..." - Manually create a task
  • Just commit your changes directly with git
```

**Exit the /jat:complete flow** - do not continue to Step 2.

#### If No Work Detected

```
No task in progress and no spontaneous work detected.

Options:
  • /jat:start - Pick a task to work on
  • bd list - View available tasks
```

**Exit the /jat:complete flow** - do not continue to Step 2.

---

#### Real Example: Spontaneous Bug Fix

**Conversation signals detected:**
```
User: "jat jat 4 crashed all terminals"
Agent: "I see the issue... The -p flag makes Claude non-interactive..."
Agent: "Let me update the jat script..."
Agent: "Now try running jat jat 4 again"
```

**Git state:**
```
M cli/jat
```

**Proposed backfill:**
```
Title: Fix jat CLI -p flag causing non-interactive sessions
Type: bug
Description: The -p flag was causing Claude Code to run in print mode
             (non-interactive), exiting immediately after processing.
             Removed -p and pass prompt as positional argument instead.
Files: cli/jat
```

---

### STEP 2: Read & Respond to Agent Mail (ALWAYS)

**THIS STEP IS MANDATORY - runs before any completion work.**

Do NOT silently batch-ack messages. Actually READ them and RESPOND if needed.

#### 2A: Check Inbox (with registration fallback)

**IMPORTANT:** If inbox fails with "Agent not found", the agent may not be registered in this session. Run `am-register` first (it's idempotent), then retry inbox.

```bash
# First attempt
am-inbox "$agent_name" --unread

# If it fails with "Agent not found":
# 1. Run: am-register --name "$agent_name" --program claude-code --model sonnet-4.5
# 2. Then retry: am-inbox "$agent_name" --unread
```

**Best practice:** Run these as separate Bash tool calls, not chained together.

#### 2B: Display Messages to User
Show the user what messages are in the inbox. Read each message.

#### 2C: Respond If Needed
- If a message asks a question → reply with `am-reply`
- If a message changes requirements → adjust your plan
- If a message says "stop" or "wait" → pause and clarify
- If a message is informational → acknowledge it

#### 2D: Acknowledge Messages
```bash
# Only AFTER reading and responding
am-inbox "$agent_name" --unread --json | jq -r '.[].id' | while read msg_id; do
  am-ack "$msg_id" --agent "$agent_name"
done
```

**Why this matters:**
- Messages might say "don't complete yet, found a bug"
- Messages might say "requirements changed"
- Messages might say "I need to review first"
- You need context BEFORE completing work

---

### STEP 3: Verify Task

**Emit `completing` signal to show progress during verification.**

```bash
echo "Verifying task before completion..."

# Emit completing signal: verifying (0% progress)
jat-signal completing '{
  "taskId": "'"$task_id"'",
  "taskTitle": "'"$task_title"'",
  "currentStep": "verifying",
  "stepsCompleted": [],
  "stepsRemaining": ["committing", "closing", "releasing", "announcing"],
  "progress": 0,
  "stepDescription": "Running verification checks (tests, lint, security)"
}'

# Run verification checks:
# - Tests
# - Lint
# - Security scan
# - Browser checks (if applicable)

# If verification fails, STOP and report issues
# Do NOT continue to completion
```

---

### STEP 4: Commit Changes

**Emit `completing` signal for the committing step.**

```bash
echo "Committing changes..."

# Emit completing signal: committing (20% progress)
jat-signal completing '{
  "taskId": "'"$task_id"'",
  "taskTitle": "'"$task_title"'",
  "currentStep": "committing",
  "stepsCompleted": ["verifying"],
  "stepsRemaining": ["closing", "releasing", "announcing"],
  "progress": 20,
  "stepDescription": "Committing changes to git"
}'

# Get task details for commit message
task_json=$(bd show "$task_id" --json)
task_title=$(echo "$task_json" | jq -r '.[0].title')
task_type=$(echo "$task_json" | jq -r '.[0].issue_type')

# Check git status
git_status=$(git status --porcelain)

if [[ -n "$git_status" ]]; then
  git add .
  git commit -m "$(cat <<EOF
$task_type: $task_title

Task: $task_id

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
else
  echo "No changes to commit"
fi
```

---

### STEP 5: Mark Task Complete in Beads

**Emit `completing` signal for the closing step.**

```bash
# Emit completing signal: closing (40% progress)
jat-signal completing '{
  "taskId": "'"$task_id"'",
  "taskTitle": "'"$task_title"'",
  "currentStep": "closing",
  "stepsCompleted": ["verifying", "committing"],
  "stepsRemaining": ["releasing", "announcing"],
  "progress": 40,
  "stepDescription": "Marking task complete in Beads"
}'

bd close "$task_id" --reason "Completed by $agent_name"
```

---

### STEP 5.5: Auto-Close Eligible Epics

**After closing a task, check if any parent epics are now fully complete.**

This ensures epics don't linger in "open" status when all children are done.

```bash
# Auto-close epics where all children are complete
bd epic close-eligible

# This command:
# - Finds all epics with issue_type=epic and status=open
# - Checks if all child tasks (by ID pattern) are closed
# - Automatically closes eligible epics
# - Reports what was closed
```

**Why this matters:**
- Without this, epics stay open forever even when all work is done
- The Epic Swarm dropdown filters out closed epics
- This keeps the task list clean and accurate

---

### STEP 6: Release File Reservations

**Emit `completing` signal for the releasing step.**

```bash
# Emit completing signal: releasing (60% progress)
jat-signal completing '{
  "taskId": "'"$task_id"'",
  "taskTitle": "'"$task_title"'",
  "currentStep": "releasing",
  "stepsCompleted": ["verifying", "committing", "closing"],
  "stepsRemaining": ["announcing"],
  "progress": 60,
  "stepDescription": "Releasing file reservations"
}'

# Release all file reservations for this agent
am-reservations --agent "$agent_name" --json | jq -r '.[].path_pattern' | while read pattern; do
  am-release "$pattern" --agent "$agent_name"
done
```

---

### STEP 7: Announce Completion

**Emit `completing` signal for the announcing step.**

```bash
# Emit completing signal: announcing (80% progress)
jat-signal completing '{
  "taskId": "'"$task_id"'",
  "taskTitle": "'"$task_title"'",
  "currentStep": "announcing",
  "stepsCompleted": ["verifying", "committing", "closing", "releasing"],
  "stepsRemaining": [],
  "progress": 80,
  "stepDescription": "Announcing completion to other agents"
}'

am-send "[$task_id] Completed: $task_title" \
  "Task completed by $agent_name.

Status: Complete
Type: $task_type
Verification: Full (tests, lint, security)" \
  --from "$agent_name" \
  --to @active \
  --thread "$task_id"
```

---

### STEP 7.5: Determine Review Action (Configurable Rules)

**After announcing completion, determine which completion signal to emit based on configurable rules.**

This step implements the review rules system that allows project-level configuration of which tasks require human review vs auto-proceed.

#### Rule Evaluation Order

```
0. Check session epic context (.claude/sessions/context-{session_id}.json)
   └─ If epic context exists with reviewThreshold:
      └─ Compare task.priority to threshold
      └─ If priority > threshold: COMPLETION_MODE="review_required" → completed signal (no autoProceed)
      └─ If priority <= threshold: COMPLETION_MODE="auto_proceed" → completed signal with autoProceed: true
   └─ Epic context takes precedence over all other rules

1. Check task.notes for [REVIEW_OVERRIDE:...] pattern
   └─ If found → Use override action (always_review, auto_proceed, force_review)

2. Load .beads/review-rules.json
   └─ Find rule matching task.issue_type
   └─ Compare task.priority to rule.maxAutoPriority

3. If config missing → review required (safe default)
```

**Note on priority semantics:** Lower priority number = higher importance (P0 is critical, P4 is lowest).
The threshold represents the HIGHEST priority number that should auto-proceed.
- `threshold: 1` → Only P0 and P1 auto-proceed, P2-P4 require review
- `threshold: 3` → P0-P3 auto-proceed, only P4 requires review

#### Implementation

```bash
# Get task details
task_json=$(bd show "$task_id" --json)
task_notes=$(echo "$task_json" | jq -r '.[0].notes // ""')
task_priority=$(echo "$task_json" | jq -r '.[0].priority')
task_type=$(echo "$task_json" | jq -r '.[0].issue_type')

COMPLETION_MODE=""  # Will be set by first matching rule: "review_required" or "auto_proceed"

# Step 0: Check session epic context (highest priority)
# Session context is set by dashboard when spawning agents for epic execution
session_id=$(~/code/jat/scripts/get-current-session-id)
context_file=".claude/sessions/context-${session_id}.json"

if [[ -f "$context_file" ]]; then
  epic_threshold=$(jq -r '.reviewThreshold // empty' "$context_file")

  if [[ -n "$epic_threshold" ]]; then
    # Convert reviewThreshold string to numeric threshold
    # 'all' = always review (threshold -1)
    # 'none' = never review (threshold 4)
    # 'p0' = only P0 requires review (threshold -1 means P0+ auto-proceed is wrong)
    # 'p0-p1' = P0-P1 require review (threshold 1, P2+ auto-proceed)
    # 'p0-p2' = P0-P2 require review (threshold 2, P3+ auto-proceed)
    case "$epic_threshold" in
      "all")
        echo "📋 Epic context: reviewThreshold='all' → All tasks require review"
        COMPLETION_MODE="review_required"
        ;;
      "none")
        echo "📋 Epic context: reviewThreshold='none' → All tasks auto-proceed"
        COMPLETION_MODE="auto_proceed"
        ;;
      "p0")
        # Only P0 requires review; P1+ auto-proceed

    # 3. Project has .beads/review-rules.json with explicit rules
    #

```

#### Review Override Values

| Override Value | COMPLETION_MODE | Behavior | Use Case |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| `always_review` | `review_required` | Session stays open for human review | Testing override behavior |
| `auto_proceed` | `auto_proceed` | Dashboard auto-spawns next task | Skip review for specific task |
| `force_review` | `review_required` | Session stays open for human review | Force review even if rules say auto |

#### Example review-rules.json

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "defaultAction": "review",
  "priorityThreshold": 3,
  "rules": [
    { "type": "bug", "maxAutoPriority": 3, "note": "P0-P3 bugs auto-proceed" },
    { "type": "feature", "maxAutoPriority": 3, "note": "P0-P3 features auto-proceed" },
    { "type": "task", "maxAutoPriority": 3 },
    { "type": "chore", "maxAutoPriority": 4, "note": "All chores auto-proceed" },
    { "type": "epic", "maxAutoPriority": -1, "note": "Epics always require review" }
  ],
  "overrides": []
}
```

**Understanding maxAutoPriority:**
- Value represents highest priority number that can auto-proceed
- Lower priority number = higher importance (P0 is most critical)
- `maxAutoPriority: 3` means P0, P1, P2, P3 can auto-proceed; P4 requires review
- `maxAutoPriority: -1` means no auto-proceed (always review)
- `maxAutoPriority: 4` means all priorities auto-proceed

#### Session Epic Context

When agents are spawned as part of an epic swarm, the dashboard writes session context to:
```
.claude/sessions/context-{session_id}.json
```

**Context file format:**
```json
{
  "epicId": "jat-abc",
  "reviewThreshold": "p0-p1",
  "spawnedAt": "2025-12-08T15:30:00.000Z"
}
```

**reviewThreshold values:**

| Value | Requires Review | Auto-Proceed |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| `all` | All priorities | None |
| `p0` | P0 only | P1-P4 |
| `p0-p1` | P0, P1 | P2-P4 |
| `p0-p2` | P0, P1, P2 | P3-P4 |
| `none` | None | All priorities |

**Dashboard integration:**

When the dashboard spawns an agent for epic execution (via `epicQueueStore.launchEpic()`), it should:

1. Call POST `/api/sessions` to spawn the agent
2. Get the session ID from the response
3. Write context file: `.claude/sessions/context-{session_id}.json`
4. Include the `reviewThreshold` from `epicQueueStore.settings`

**Example dashboard code:**
```typescript
// After spawning agent
const contextPath = `.claude/sessions/context-${sessionId}.json`;
const context = {
  epicId: state.epicId,
  reviewThreshold: state.settings.reviewThreshold,
  spawnedAt: new Date().toISOString()
};
await writeFile(contextPath, JSON.stringify(context, null, 2));
```

**Note:** Epic context takes precedence over all other review rules. This allows the human commander to set a review threshold for the entire epic swarm, overriding per-project or per-task defaults.

---

### STEP 8: Emit Structured Completion Signal

**CRITICAL: Emit a structured completion signal so the dashboard can render an interactive UI.**

Instead of just outputting text, you MUST build a JSON completion bundle and emit it via `jat-signal complete`. This enables:
- One-click task creation for suggested follow-up work
- Interactive checklist for human actions
- Structured display of quality signals and cross-agent intel

**Before building the bundle, actively search for follow-up work.** Look at:
- Files you modified - any related issues?
- Adjacent code - tech debt or improvements?
- Test coverage - gaps you noticed?
- Documentation - needs updating?

You MUST include at least one suggested task (see suggestedTasks below).

#### Build the Completion Bundle

Analyze your work and build a JSON object with these fields:

```typescript
interface CompletionBundle {
  // REQUIRED
  taskId: string;           // The task ID (e.g., "jat-abc")
  agentName: string;        // Your agent name
  summary: string[];        // Array of accomplishment bullet points

  // REQUIRED - Completion mode from Step 7.5
  completionMode: "review_required" | "auto_proceed";
  // If auto_proceed, include next task info
  nextTaskId?: string;      // ID of next task to auto-spawn
  nextTaskTitle?: string;   // Title of next task

  // REQUIRED - Quality signals
  quality: {
    tests: "passing" | "failing" | "none" | "skipped";
    build: "clean" | "warnings" | "errors";
    preExisting?: string;   // Note if issues were pre-existing
  };

  // OPTIONAL - Only if manual steps needed
  humanActions?: Array<{
    title: string;          // Short title (3-8 words)
    description: string;    // Detailed steps
  }>;

  // REQUIRED - Always look for follow-up work!
  // If you genuinely found nothing, explain why in a single task with type "task"

```

#### Emit the Signal

```bash
# Build the JSON (escape quotes properly!)
# Use COMPLETION_MODE from Step 7.5
jat-signal complete '{
  "taskId": "jat-abc",
  "agentName": "WisePrairie",
  "completionMode": "review_required",
  "summary": [
    "Fixed authentication flow for OAuth providers",
    "Added retry logic for failed token refreshes"
  ],
  "quality": {
    "tests": "passing",
    "build": "clean"
  },
  "humanActions": [
    {
      "title": "Enable OAuth in Supabase",
      "description": "Go to Authentication > Providers and enable Google OAuth"
    }
  ],
  "suggestedTasks": [
    {
      "type": "feature",
      "title": "Add Apple Sign-In support",
      "description": "Similar flow to Google OAuth, needs Apple Developer account setup",
      "priority": 2,
      "reason": "Discovered while implementing Google OAuth",
      "project": "chimaro",
      "labels": "auth,oauth,ios"
    },
    {
      "type": "task",
      "title": "Add OAuth error tracking",
      "description": "Log failed OAuth attempts to Sentry for debugging",
      "priority": 3,
      "depends_on": ["jat-abc"]
    }
  ],
  "crossAgentIntel": {
    "files": ["src/lib/auth/oauth.ts", "src/routes/auth/callback/+server.ts"],
    "patterns": ["Use authError() helper for consistent error responses"],
    "gotchas": ["Token refresh can fail silently - always check response.ok"]
  }
}'
```

**For auto-proceed mode:** Include `nextTaskId` and `nextTaskTitle`:
```bash
jat-signal complete '{
  "taskId": "jat-abc",
  "agentName": "WisePrairie",
  "completionMode": "auto_proceed",
  "nextTaskId": "jat-def",
  "nextTaskTitle": "Add tests for OAuth flow",
  "summary": [...],
  ...
}'
```

**JSON Escaping Rules:**
- Use single quotes around the entire JSON argument
- Use double quotes inside JSON (standard JSON format)
- Escape any internal single quotes with `'\''` if needed
- Test with `echo '...' | jq .` to validate

#### Then Output Full Terminal Debrief

After emitting the signal, output a comprehensive completion summary. **This is a full debrief for the user, not just a log.**

The terminal summary should mirror everything in the signal - the user viewing the terminal deserves the same complete information as the dashboard UI.

💡 Session complete. Dashboard shows interactive UI for creating suggested tasks.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Section Guidelines:**

| Section | When to Include | What to Show |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED | Always | All summary bullets from signal |
| QUALITY STATUS | Always | Tests and build status with details |
| HUMAN ACTIONS REQUIRED | If humanActions in signal | Full title + description for each |
| SUGGESTED FOLLOW-UP TASKS | If suggestedTasks in signal | Priority, type, title, description, reason |
| CROSS-AGENT INTEL | If crossAgentIntel in signal | Files, patterns, gotchas |
| PATTERN APPLICABILITY | When applicable | How patterns used here apply elsewhere |

**Omit sections if empty** - don't show "None" for empty sections, just skip them.

**The dashboard ALSO renders this information** via the structured signal, but the terminal debrief ensures users who primarily interact via terminal get the full context.

---

### Field Guidelines

#### Human Actions (humanActions)

Include when the user must take manual steps for the task to be truly complete:
- Run migration in production
- Enable feature flags
- Configure third-party services
- Update environment variables
- Deploy to production
- Manual testing required

**Do NOT include:**
- "Review the code" (that's implied)
- "Test in browser" (you should have done this)
- General suggestions (those go in suggestedTasks)

#### Suggested Tasks (suggestedTasks) - REQUIRED

**You MUST always include suggested tasks.** Before completing, actively search for:
- Similar code that needs the same fix
- Tech debt you noticed while working
- Features that would improve the area you worked on
- Bugs you found but didn't fix (out of scope)
- Documentation that needs updating
- Tests that should be added
- Error handling improvements
- Performance optimizations noticed

**If you genuinely found nothing after searching**, include one task explaining this:
```json
{
  "type": "task",
  "title": "Review [area] for improvements",
  "description": "Completed [task] - code was clean, no obvious follow-up needed. Future reviewer should check for edge cases.",
  "priority": 4,
  "reason": "No immediate follow-up discovered during task completion"
}
```

**Priority Guide:**
- P0: Critical - blocks other work or has security implications
- P1: High - should be done soon, impacts users
- P2: Medium - normal backlog priority
- P3: Low - nice to have
- P4: Backlog - someday/maybe

**Optional but Recommended Fields:**
- **project**: Set to the current project ID (e.g., "jat", "chimaro"). Defaults to current project if omitted.
- **labels**: Comma-separated labels for categorization (e.g., "ui,auth,performance"). Use when the task belongs to a specific area.
- **depends_on**: Array of task IDs that must complete first (e.g., `["jat-abc"]`). Use when:
  - The suggested task requires output from another task
  - Tasks have a natural ordering (create feature, then add tests)
  - You're suggesting multiple related tasks where one builds on another

#### Cross-Agent Intel (crossAgentIntel)

Share knowledge that helps other agents working in the same codebase:
- **files**: Key files you modified (helps avoid conflicts)
- **patterns**: Conventions you followed or established
- **gotchas**: Non-obvious issues you encountered

---

### What the Dashboard Does

When it receives the `complete` signal:

1. **Human Actions Panel** - Shows checklist with checkboxes
   - User can check off actions as they complete them
   - Uncompleted actions show warning indicator

2. **Suggested Tasks Panel** - Shows task cards
   - Each task has "Create in Beads" button
   - One-click creation with all fields pre-filled
   - Bulk "Create All" option

3. **Quality Badge** - Visual indicator
   - Green checkmark for passing/clean
   - Yellow warning for warnings/pre-existing issues
   - Red X for failures

4. **Cross-Agent Intel** - Collapsible section
   - Files listed with copy buttons
   - Patterns and gotchas displayed for reference

---

### Individual Signal Commands

The individual signal commands can be used separately if needed:

```bash
# Separate signals (prefer jat-signal complete bundle)
jat-signal action '{"title":"...","description":"..."}'
jat-signal tasks '[{"type":"feature","title":"...","priority":2}]'
jat-signal completed '{"taskId":"...","agentName":"...","sessionStats":{...},"finalCommit":"..."}'
```

**Prefer `jat-signal complete '{...}'`** - it bundles everything in one call and provides a better dashboard experience.

### Enhanced Completed Signal

The `completed` signal now includes session statistics and final state information:

```bash
jat-signal completed '{
  "taskId": "jat-abc",
  "agentName": "WisePrairie",
  "summary": ["Implemented OAuth flow", "Added login page"],
  "quality": {
    "tests": "passing",
    "build": "clean"
  },
  "suggestedTasks": [
    {
      "type": "feature",
      "title": "Add Apple Sign-In support",
      "priority": 2
    }
  ],
  "sessionStats": {
    "duration": 45,
    "tokensUsed": 150000,
    "filesModified": 5,
    "linesChanged": 320,
    "commitsCreated": 2
  },
  "finalCommit": "abc123def456",
  "prLink": "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123"
}'
```

#### Session Stats Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `duration` | integer | Minutes spent working on the task |
| `tokensUsed` | integer | API tokens consumed during the session |
| `filesModified` | integer | Number of files modified |
| `linesChanged` | integer | Total lines changed (added + removed) |
| `commitsCreated` | integer | Number of commits created |

#### Final State Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `finalCommit` | string | Yes | Git SHA of the final committed state |
| `prLink` | string | No | Pull request URL if one was created |

## Quick Mode Behavior

**This command does NOT have a quick mode.**

Full verification ensures quality before task closure.

**Still done (NEVER skip these):**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 Session complete. Dashboard shows interactive UI for creating suggested tasks.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Signal explained:**
- `jat-signal complete '{...}'` - Full completion bundle with all data; dashboard shows COMPLETED state and renders interactive UI
- Set `completionMode: "auto_proceed"` with `nextTaskId` and `nextTaskTitle` to auto-spawn next task

The completion mode is determined by review rules (see Step 7.5).

---

## Dashboard State Signals

The completion flow uses these signals (captured by PostToolUse hook):

| Signal Command | When to Run | Dashboard Effect |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| `jat-signal completing '{...}'` | During each completion step | Shows progress bar and current step |
| `jat-signal complete '{...}'` | After all completion steps | Full completion bundle with summary, suggested tasks, human actions, cross-agent intel |

**The `jat-signal complete` bundle is the ONLY completion signal needed.** It includes:
- `completionMode: "review_required"` → Dashboard shows COMPLETED state, session stays open for review
- `completionMode: "auto_proceed"` with `nextTaskId` → Dashboard auto-spawns next task

**Legacy signals (deprecated):** The individual `completed`, `auto_proceed`, `action`, and `tasks` signals still work but should NOT be used. The `complete` bundle replaces all of them.

### Completing Signal Progress Sequence

The `completing` signal is emitted at each step of the completion workflow:

| Step | currentStep | progress | stepsCompleted | stepsRemaining |
|------|-------------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 3 | `verifying` | 0% | [] | [committing, closing, releasing, announcing] |
| 4 | `committing` | 20% | [verifying] | [closing, releasing, announcing] |
| 5 | `closing` | 40% | [verifying, committing] | [releasing, announcing] |
| 6 | `releasing` | 60% | [verifying, committing, closing] | [announcing] |
| 7 | `announcing` | 80% | [verifying, committing, closing, releasing] | [] |
| 8 | (complete) | 100% | All steps | [] |

**Completing Signal Payload:**
```bash
jat-signal completing '{
  "taskId": "jat-abc",
  "taskTitle": "Add user authentication",
  "currentStep": "committing",
  "stepsCompleted": ["verifying"],
  "stepsRemaining": ["closing", "releasing", "announcing"],
  "progress": 20,
  "stepDescription": "Committing changes to git"
}'
```

**Dashboard renders:** Progress bar at 20%, "Step 2/5: Committing changes to git"

**Completion mode is determined in Step 7.5** based on:
1. Per-task override in notes (`[REVIEW_OVERRIDE:...]`)
2. Project review rules (`.beads/review-rules.json`)
3. Safe default: review required (no auto-proceed without explicit configuration)

**Critical timing:**
- Do NOT run `jat-signal complete` until AFTER all completion steps succeed
- If you signal early, dashboard shows "complete" but task is still open in Beads
- This causes confusion - other agents think task is done when it isn't

**Human actions:**
- Include in the `humanActions` array within the `jat-signal complete` bundle
- Dashboard renders these as an interactive checklist for manual steps

**Only one signal call needed:** Use `jat-signal complete` with the full bundle (Step 8).

---

## Handling CREATE_TASKS Input from Dashboard

**When the dashboard sends `[JAT:CREATE_TASKS]` input, handle it before the completion summary.**

This happens when:
1. Agent runs `jat-signal tasks` with follow-up tasks
2. Dashboard displays SuggestedTasksPanel UI
3. User selects tasks and clicks "Create Selected Tasks"
4. Dashboard sends `[JAT:CREATE_TASKS]{...json...}[/JAT:CREATE_TASKS]` to agent's terminal
5. Agent parses this input and creates tasks in Beads

### Input Format

```
[JAT:CREATE_TASKS]
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "agent",
      "title": "Add caching to /api/agents endpoint",
      "description": "Same Redis pattern as /api/tasks. Copy approach from cache.ts.",
      "priority": 2
    },
    {
      "type": "human",
      "title": "Decide on cache TTL strategy",
      "description": "Current TTL is 60s. Need product input on freshness vs performance tradeoff.",
      "priority": 2
    }
  ],
  "parent_task_id": "jat-xyz"
}
[/JAT:CREATE_TASKS]
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `tasks` | Yes | array | Array of tasks to create |
| `tasks[].type` | Yes | `"agent"` or `"human"` | Who should do this work |
| `tasks[].title` | Yes | string | Task title (3-10 words) |
| `tasks[].priority` | Yes | number | 0-4 (P0=critical, P4=lowest) |
| `tasks[].description` | No | string | Detailed description |
| `tasks[].labels` | No | string[] | Labels for categorization |
| `parent_task_id` | No | string | Parent task ID for linking |

### Implementation Steps

**When you detect CREATE_TASKS input in the terminal or receive it as user input:**

#### Step 1: Parse the JSON Payload

```bash
# The input will look like:
# [JAT:CREATE_TASKS]{"tasks":[...]}[/JAT:CREATE_TASKS]
#
# Parse between the markers to extract JSON
```

Extract the JSON payload and validate it has the required fields.

#### Step 2: Create Each Task in Beads

For each task in the `tasks` array:

```bash
# For agent tasks:
bd create "Task title here" \
  --description "Task description" \
  --priority 2 \
  --type task

# For human tasks, add human-action label:
bd create "Human task title here" \
  --description "Task description" \
  --priority 2 \
  --type task \
  --labels "human-action"

# If labels were provided:
bd create "Task title" \
  --description "Description" \
  --priority 2 \
  --type task \
  --labels "label1,label2"
```

**Capture the created task ID from the output** (format: `✓ Created issue: jat-xxx`).

#### Step 3: Link to Parent Task (Optional)

If `parent_task_id` was provided, link the new tasks:

```bash
# Add dependency relationship (syntax: bd dep add [new-id] [parent-id] --type discovered-from)
bd dep add jat-newid jat-parentid --type discovered-from
```

#### Step 4: Output Confirmation

```

  • jat-abc - Add caching to /api/agents endpoint (agent)
  • jat-def - Add cache metrics to dashboard (agent)
  • jat-ghi - Decide on cache TTL strategy (human)

  Linked to parent: jat-xyz
```

#### Step 5: Continue with Completion Flow

After creating tasks, continue with the normal `/jat:complete` flow (verification, commit, close, announce).

### Error Handling

**JSON parse error:**
```
⚠️ CREATE_TASKS: Invalid JSON payload
   Error: Unexpected token at position 45
   Skipping task creation, continuing with completion...
```

**bd create fails for one task:**
```
📋 Creating suggested tasks from dashboard...

✓ jat-abc - Add caching to /api/agents endpoint
✗ Failed: Add cache metrics - bd create error: duplicate title
✓ jat-ghi - Decide on cache TTL strategy

2 of 3 tasks created successfully.
```

**Handle errors gracefully** - report which task failed but continue creating others.

### Example Output

```
[User sends from dashboard:]
[JAT:CREATE_TASKS]{"tasks":[{"type":"agent","title":"Add unit tests for cache layer","description":"Cover cache hit/miss scenarios","priority":2},{"type":"human","title":"Review cache invalidation strategy","description":"Ensure we invalidate on all write paths","priority":1}],"parent_task_id":"jat-xyz"}[/JAT:CREATE_TASKS]

[Agent response:]

✓ Created: jat-abc

Running: bd create "Review cache invalidation strategy" --description "Ensure we invalidate on all write paths" --priority 1 --type task --labels "human-action"
✓ Created: jat-def

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Created 2 tasks from suggestions: jat-abc, jat-def
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Continuing with completion flow...]
```

### Integration with Completion Flow

The CREATE_TASKS handling should happen **after showing the completion summary** but **before running `jat-signal idle`**:

1. Steps 1-7 run normally (verify, commit, close, release, announce)
2. Show completion summary box (Step 8)
3. **Wait for potential CREATE_TASKS input from dashboard**
   - If user sends CREATE_TASKS → parse and create tasks → confirm
   - If user sends nothing / closes terminal → proceed to IDLE
4. Run `jat-signal idle`

This allows the dashboard to:
1. Read suggested tasks from signal file (`jat-signal tasks`)
2. Show the SuggestedTasksPanel UI to user
3. User selects and clicks "Create Selected Tasks"
4. Dashboard sends CREATE_TASKS to still-running agent
5. Agent creates tasks and confirms

**Note:** The agent session should remain open briefly after showing completion summary to allow this interaction. The `jat-signal idle` call signals the session can be closed.

---

## Error Handling

**No active session:**
```
No active session detected.
Run /jat:start to begin working
```

**No task in progress (with spontaneous work):**
```
🔍 SPONTANEOUS WORK DETECTED
[Proposal displayed, user confirms]
✓ Created backfill task: jat-xyz
[Continues to normal completion flow]
```

**No task in progress (no work detected):**
```
No task in progress and no spontaneous work detected.
Run /jat:start to pick a task
```

**Verification failed:**
```
Task verification failed:
   • 2 tests failing
   • 5 lint errors

Fix issues and try again
Or run /jat:verify to see detailed error report
```

## Step Summary

| Step | Name | When | Completing Signal |
|------|------|------|-------------------|
| 1A-C | Get Task and Agent Identity | ALWAYS | - |
| 1D | Spontaneous Work Detection | If no in_progress task found | - |
| 2 | Read & Respond to Mail | ALWAYS (after task identified) | - |
| 3 | Verify Task | ALWAYS | `verifying` (0%) |
| 4 | Commit Changes | ALWAYS | `committing` (20%) |
| 5 | Mark Task Complete | ALWAYS | `closing` (40%) |
| 5.5 | Auto-Close Eligible Epics | ALWAYS | - |
| 6 | Release Reservations | ALWAYS | `releasing` (60%) |
| 7 | Announce Completion | ALWAYS | `announcing` (80%) |
| 7.5 | Determine Review Action | ALWAYS (sets COMPLETION_MODE) | - |
| 8 | Show Final Summary with Reflection | ALWAYS | (100% implied) |
| 9 | Handle CREATE_TASKS Input | If dashboard sends task creation request | - |

---

## Key Design Principles

1. **Always check Agent Mail first**
   - Read messages BEFORE completing work
   - Respond to questions, don't just ack
   - Context matters for decision-making

2. **Full verification required**
   - No quick mode for this command
   - Quality over speed

3. **One agent = one session = one task**
   - Session ENDS after completion (do NOT show "Available Tasks")
   - User spawns new agent for next task
   - Keeps context clean and focused
   - Completion summary shows: what was accomplished, suggested follow-ups, human actions

## Epic/Child Task Architecture

**Epics are blocked by their children, not the other way around.**

### Dependency Direction

When creating an epic with child tasks, the dependencies must be set up correctly:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    CORRECT DEPENDENCY STRUCTURE                          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                          │
│  jat-abc (Epic): "Improve Dashboard"                                    │
│    └─ DEPENDS ON (blocked by):                                          │
│         → jat-abc.1: "Add caching" [READY - can start immediately]      │
│         → jat-abc.2: "Optimize queries" [READY - can start immediately] │
│         → jat-abc.3: "Add tests" [READY - can start immediately]        │
│                                                                          │
│  Flow:                                                                   │
│    1. Children are READY (no blockers, agents can pick them up)         │
│    2. Epic is BLOCKED (waiting for all children to complete)            │
│    3. When all children complete → Epic becomes READY                   │
│    4. Epic is then verification/UAT task                                │
│                                                                          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                          │
│  jat-abc (Epic): "Improve Dashboard"                                    │
│    └─ BLOCKS:                                                           │
│         ← jat-abc.1: "Add caching" [BLOCKED - waiting on epic!]         │
│         ← jat-abc.2: "Optimize queries" [BLOCKED]                       │
│         ← jat-abc.3: "Add tests" [BLOCKED]                              │
│                                                                          │
│  Problem: Epic appears READY but has no real work defined               │
│  Problem: Children can't start until epic is "done"                     │
│  Problem: Agent picks epic and tries to do ALL the child work           │
│                                                                          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Creating Epic with Children (Correct Pattern)

**Step 1: Create the epic (will be blocked by children)**
```bash
bd create "Improve Dashboard Performance" \
  --type epic \
  --description "Parent epic for performance improvements. This task becomes verification/UAT once all children complete." \
  --priority 1
# → Creates: jat-abc
```

**Step 2: Create child tasks**
```bash
# Create children as separate tasks
bd create "Add caching layer" --type task --priority 2
# → Creates: jat-def

bd create "Optimize database queries" --type task --priority 2
# → Creates: jat-ghi

bd create "Add performance tests" --type task --priority 3
# → Creates: jat-jkl
```

**Step 3: Set up dependencies (epic depends on children)**
```bash
# Epic is blocked by each child (NOT children blocked by epic!)
bd dep add jat-abc jat-def   # Epic depends on child 1
bd dep add jat-abc jat-ghi   # Epic depends on child 2
bd dep add jat-abc jat-jkl   # Epic depends on child 3
```

**Result:**
- `jat-abc` (epic) shows as BLOCKED until all children complete
- Children (`jat-def`, `jat-ghi`, `jat-jkl`) show as READY
- Agents can pick up children immediately
- When all children complete, epic becomes READY for verification

### Fixing Incorrectly Created Epics

If you have an epic with wrong dependency direction:

```bash
# Check current state
bd show jat-abc
# If it shows "Blocks: ← jat-abc.1, ← jat-abc.2" - it's WRONG

# Fix by removing and re-adding dependencies
bd dep remove jat-abc.1 jat-abc    # Remove child → parent dep
bd dep remove jat-abc.2 jat-abc
bd dep remove jat-abc.3 jat-abc

bd dep add jat-abc jat-abc.1       # Add parent → child dep (correct)
bd dep add jat-abc jat-abc.2
bd dep add jat-abc jat-abc.3

# Verify fix
bd show jat-abc
# Should now show "Depends on: → jat-abc.1, → jat-abc.2, → jat-abc.3"
```

---

## Completing an Epic (Verification/UAT Workflow)

**When all children are done, the epic becomes a verification task.**

When you pick up an epic that has become READY (all children completed), your job is:

1. **Verify all children are actually complete**
   - Check each child task is closed in Beads
   - Review the work done by child agents

2. **Run integration/UAT verification**
   - Run full test suite
   - Check for integration issues between components
   - Verify the combined work achieves the epic's goal

3. **Check for loose ends**
   - Any human actions that weren't completed?
   - Any suggested tasks that should become real tasks?
   - Any documentation that needs updating?

4. **Complete the epic normally**
   - If verification passes: run `/jat:complete`
   - If issues found: create follow-up tasks, document issues

## Completing a Child Task (Epic Context)

When completing a child task that belongs to an epic:

**Step 1: Complete normally** using the standard completion flow.

**Step 2: Check if this was the LAST child**

```bash
# Check if parent epic still has blockers
parent_id=$(echo "$task_id" | sed 's/\.[0-9]*$//')
remaining=$(bd show "$parent_id" --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.status != "closed") | .id' | grep -v "$parent_id")

if [[ -z "$remaining" ]]; then
  echo "🎉 This was the last child! Parent epic jat-abc is now READY for verification."
fi
```

**Step 3: Include epic status in completion summary:**

When completing a child task that belongs to an epic, add an "EPIC STATUS" section after the header:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  ✅ TASK COMPLETED: jat-abc.3 "Add performance tests"                     ║

[... rest of standard full debrief sections ...]
```

This helps the commander know when an epic is ready for final verification.
