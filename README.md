Agent Mail (multi-agent coordination) + Beads (task planning) + 28 bash tools + 10 coordination commands = Full swarm orchestration that transcends context windows and project boundaries.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joewinke/jomarchy-agent-tools/main/install.sh | bash
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install (run in your terminal/bash)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joewinke/jomarchy-agent-tools/main/install.sh | bash

# 2. Register your agent (run inside your AI coding assistant)
/register

# 3. Create your project plan (tell your agent what to build)
# Paste a detailed PRD or feature description, then:
/plan

# 4. Start working on tasks
/start
```

**From idea to working code in 5 minutes!** The installer sets up Agent Mail, Beads CLI, 28 tools, and 10 coordination commands. Your AI assistant gains multi-agent swarm coordination capabilities instantly.

### How It Actually Works

1. **Installation** (bash terminal): Installs coordination tools globally
2. **Agent Registration** (AI assistant): Links assistant to Agent Mail system
3. **Planning Session** (AI assistant): Converts your PRD/requirements into Beads tasks
4. **Execution** (AI assistant or swarm): Agents pick tasks from queue and coordinate automatically

See [Complete Workflow](#complete-workflow-from-idea-to-production) below for detailed walkthrough.

## What Is This?

Jomarchy Agent Tools is a **self-contained AI development environment** that gives your AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cline, Roo Code, OpenCode, etc.) the ability to:

- **Command** agent swarms with high-level coordination primitives (/start, /complete, /handoff)
- **Coordinate** across multiple agents without conflicts (Agent Mail messaging + file locks)
- **Transcend** project folders and context window bounds with persistent state
- **Plan** work with dependency-aware task management (Beads)
- **Execute** with 28 composable bash tools (no HTTP servers, no running daemons)
- **Scale** infinitely - add agents without coordination overhead

### 🏗️ Architecture

Messages +    Task Queue +  Operations
File Locks    Dependencies  (db, browser, etc)
```

**How it works:**
1. **AI Assistants** use coordination commands (`/start`, `/complete`, etc.)
2. **Commands** orchestrate the three layers below
3. **Agent Mail** handles messaging and file reservation conflicts
4. **Beads** manages task queue with dependency resolution
5. **Tools** perform operations (database, browser, monitoring, etc.)

---

## Why Use This?

### The Problem

Modern AI coding assistants face three major challenges:

1. **Coordination chaos**: Multiple agents editing the same files simultaneously, no way to communicate across context windows
2. **Project isolation**: Agents trapped in single folders, can't coordinate across repositories
3. **Context amnesia**: Agents lose task state between sessions, repeat work unnecessarily

### The Solution

**Jomarchy Agent Tools breaks these boundaries:**

| Challenge | Solution | Benefit |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Coordination chaos | Agent Mail (messaging + file reservations) | Swarm coordination without conflicts |
| Project isolation | Cross-project communication threads | Agents coordinate across repositories |
| Context amnesia | Beads (git-backed task database) | Persistent state transcends sessions |

**Real-world impact:**
- **Control agent swarms** that span multiple projects and coding assistants
- **No running services**: Just bash scripts + SQLite (32k+ token savings vs MCP servers)
- **Universal compatibility**: Works with any AI assistant that supports bash + slash commands
- **Bash composability**: Pipe, filter, and chain tools with jq, xargs, grep

---

## 🎯 Real-World Workflows

### Scenario 1: Parallel Error Remediation

**The Challenge:** 100 TypeScript errors across 20 files

**The Swarm:**
```bash
# Agent 1
/register
/start  # Auto-picks: "Fix type errors in auth/"
# ... fixes 15 errors in 8 minutes ...
/complete  # ✅ Auto-starts next: "Fix type errors in ui/"

# Agent 2 (parallel session)
/register
/start  # Gets: "Fix type errors in api/"
# ... fixes 12 errors in 6 minutes ...
/complete  # ✅ Continues to next chunk

# Agent 3 (parallel session)
/start  # Gets: "Fix type errors in lib/"
```

**Result:** All 100 errors fixed in 18 minutes across 3 agents with **zero conflicts** (file reservations prevent collisions).

### Scenario 2: Multi-Agent Feature Development

**The Challenge:** Implement Stripe payments (backend + frontend + tests)

**The Coordination:**
```bash
# Backend Agent
/start stripe-webhooks  # Implements webhook handling
# ... builds /api/webhooks/stripe endpoint ...
/complete  # ✅ Marks complete, unblocks frontend

# Frontend Agent (waits for dependency)
/start stripe-ui  # Shows as "blocked" until stripe-webhooks done
# Once unblocked, starts automatically
# ... builds PaymentForm component ...
/complete

# QA Agent
/start stripe-tests  # Depends on both tasks
# Runs integration tests across full flow
```

**Result:** Coordinated feature development with **automatic dependency resolution** and **zero rework**.

### Scenario 3: Cross-Project Coordination

**The Challenge:** Auth system spans 3 repos (backend, frontend, mobile)

**The Architecture:**
```bash
# Backend Agent (in backend repo)
am-register --project backend
/start auth-api
# ... implements JWT endpoints ...
am-send Frontend "Auth API ready: /api/auth/login"

# Frontend Agent (in frontend repo)
am-inbox Frontend  # Sees message from Backend
/start auth-ui
# ... builds login form, connects to API ...

# Mobile Agent (in mobile repo)
am-inbox Mobile  # Gets notified
/start auth-mobile
# ... implements OAuth flow ...
```

**Result:** Three agents across three repositories **coordinate via Agent Mail** with shared context and **zero miscommunication**.

## 📖 Complete Workflow: From Idea to Production

**This is the workflow curse-of-knowledge gap that most docs miss!** Here's the actual end-to-end process:

### Step 1: Write a Detailed PRD (You, in a text editor)

Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document with:
- **What** you're building (feature overview)
- **Why** you're building it (business goals, user needs)
- **How** it should work (user flows, edge cases)
- **Success criteria** (how you'll know it's done)
- **Technical considerations** (architecture, dependencies)

**Example PRD:**
```markdown
# Feature: Real-time Collaborative Whiteboard

## Overview
Build a real-time collaborative whiteboard where multiple users can draw,
add shapes, and comment simultaneously with WebSocket synchronization.

## Business Goals
- Enable remote team collaboration
- Replace expensive third-party tools
- Integrate with our existing project management suite

## User Flows
1. User creates new whiteboard
2. User invites collaborators via link
3. Multiple users draw/comment in real-time
4. Changes sync instantly (<100ms latency)
5. Whiteboard auto-saves every 30 seconds

## Technical Requirements
- WebSocket server for real-time sync
- Canvas API for drawing
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- PostgreSQL for persistence
- Redis for session management

## Success Criteria
- Support 10+ concurrent users per whiteboard
- <100ms sync latency
- Zero data loss on disconnection
- Mobile responsive
```

### Step 2: Planning Session (You + AI Agent)

**In your AI coding assistant:**

```
You: [Paste your entire PRD here]

I want to build this feature. Please analyze this PRD and create a
comprehensive task breakdown using /plan.

Agent: [Reads PRD, analyzes dependencies, creates task hierarchy]
       [Calls /plan internally]

       ✅ Created 23 tasks in Beads:
          - 5 P0 (foundation - no dependencies)
          - 12 P1 (core features)
          - 6 P2 (polish & optimization)

       Tasks are ready in the queue. Run /start to begin!
```

**What `/plan` does behind the scenes:**
1. Analyzes your PRD for components, dependencies, and complexity
2. Breaks work into atomic, testable tasks
3. Creates Beads tasks with proper dependency chains
4. Sets priorities (P0 = foundation, P1 = features, P2 = polish)
5. Generates task descriptions with acceptance criteria

**Example Beads tasks created:**
```
bd-001 (P0): Set up WebSocket server infrastructure
bd-002 (P0): Create PostgreSQL schema for whiteboards
bd-003 (P0): Implement Redis session store
bd-004 (P1): Build Canvas drawing component [depends: bd-001]
bd-005 (P1): Implement real-time sync protocol [depends: bd-001, bd-003]
bd-006 (P1): Add conflict resolution [depends: bd-005]
...
```

### Step 3: Single Agent Execution (One AI assistant)

**Simple workflow - one agent tackles tasks sequentially:**

```bash
# In your AI coding assistant
/register  # Creates agent identity in Agent Mail

/start     # Auto-picks highest priority task with no blockers
           # Agent reserves files, announces start via Agent Mail
           # Works on bd-001: "Set up WebSocket server"

/complete  # Marks bd-001 done, auto-starts bd-002
           # Continuous flow - no manual task selection needed

/complete  # Finishes bd-002, moves to bd-003
...
```

**Key benefits:**
- `/start` always picks the **right** task (highest priority, no blockers)
- `/complete` automatically chains to next task
- File reservations prevent conflicts if you later add more agents
- Progress persists in Beads (survives session restarts)

### Step 4: Multi-Agent Swarm (Advanced - parallel work)

**When you want to go faster, add more agents:**

**Agent 1 (Claude Code):**
```bash
/register --name Frontend
/start  # Gets: bd-004 "Build Canvas drawing component"
        # Reserves: src/components/Canvas/**
        # Announces: "Starting bd-004" via Agent Mail
```

**Agent 2 (Cline in separate window):**
```bash
/register --name Backend
/start  # Gets: bd-005 "Implement real-time sync protocol"
        # Reserves: src/server/websocket/**
        # Announces: "Starting bd-005" via Agent Mail
```

**Agent 3 (Roo Code in third window):**
```bash
/register --name Database
/start  # Gets: bd-002 "Create PostgreSQL schema"
        # Reserves: migrations/**
        # Announces: "Starting bd-002" via Agent Mail
```

**What happens automatically:**
- Agents pick different tasks (Beads prevents duplicates)
- File reservations prevent conflicts (exclusive locks)
- Agents coordinate via Agent Mail (announcements, blockers)
- Dependencies auto-resolve (bd-006 waits for bd-005)

### Step 5: Coordination & Communication

**Agents communicate via Agent Mail:**

```bash
# Backend agent finishes WebSocket server
/complete  # Auto-sends: "[bd-001 Complete] WebSocket server ready at ws://localhost:3000"

# Frontend agent sees notification
am-inbox Frontend --unread
# → Message from Backend: "WebSocket server ready..."
# → Can now connect Canvas component

# If agent gets blocked
/block "bd-006 blocked: need Redis connection string from DevOps"
# → Sends high-priority message to team
# → Marks task as blocked in Beads
# → Auto-starts different task
```

### Step 6: Verification & Completion

**Each agent verifies work before marking complete:**

```bash
/verify full    # For UI changes (runs browser tests)
/verify quick   # For backend changes (type check, lint, security)

# If verification passes:
/complete       # Commits code, updates docs, releases file locks

# If verification fails:
# Agent self-corrects or calls code-refactorer
# Does NOT mark complete until all checks pass
```

### Step 7: Feature Completion & PR

**When all related tasks complete, auto-create PR:**

```bash
# Agent completes bd-023 (last task in feature)
/complete

# System detects feature completion:
# - 23 tasks completed in last 48 hours
# - All tasks have "whiteboard" label
# - Branch has 47 commits since main

# Auto-creates PR:
📋 PR #123: Real-time Collaborative Whiteboard
   Includes 23 tasks, 47 commits, 89 files changed
   ✅ All verification checks passed
   🔗 Ready for review
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts to Understand

### Beads Tasks Are Your Source of Truth
- **Don't** manually pick tasks - let `/start` choose based on priority + dependencies
- **Don't** create tasks manually - let `/plan` analyze your PRD
- **Do** write detailed PRDs - garbage in, garbage out

### File Reservations Prevent Conflicts
- Agents automatically reserve files when starting tasks
- Other agents see "FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT" and pick different work
- Reservations auto-expire (default: 1 hour TTL)

### Agent Mail Keeps Everyone Synced
- Announcements when starting/completing tasks
- Notifications about blockers or dependencies
- Cross-project coordination (backend ↔ frontend)

### Verification Gates Ensure Quality
- `/verify` runs before `/complete` (mandatory)
- Failed verification = task stays open, agent self-corrects
- No "done but broken" tasks

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Revisited)

Now that you understand the workflow:

```bash
# 1. Install (terminal)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joewinke/jomarchy-agent-tools/main/install.sh | bash

# 2. Write PRD (text editor)
vim feature-spec.md  # Detailed requirements document

# 3. Planning (AI assistant)
[Paste PRD]
"Break this down into Beads tasks using /plan"

# 4. Execute (AI assistant or swarm)
/register
/start    # Pick first task
/complete # Finish and auto-continue
...       # Repeat until feature done

# 5. Review PR (GitHub)
# Auto-created when feature tasks complete
```

**That's it!** The tools handle coordination, the agent handles coding, you handle product decisions.

---

### 1. Agent Mail

**Multi-agent coordination system (bash + SQLite)**

**Database:** `~/.agent-mail.db`

**Features:**
- Agent identity management (register, whoami)
- Inbox/outbox messaging with threads
- File reservation system (prevent conflicts)
- Searchable message archives
- Human-auditable Git artifacts

**Usage:**
```bash
am-register --program claude-code --model sonnet-4.5
am-inbox AgentName --unread
am-send "Subject" "Body" --from Agent1 --to Agent2 --thread task-123
am-reserve "src/**" --agent AgentName --ttl 3600 --reason "task-123"
```

### 2. Beads CLI

**Dependency-aware task planning**

```bash
# Verify installation
bd --version
```

**Features:**
- Per-project task databases (`.beads/` directory)
- Dependency tracking (blocks/blocked-by relationships)
- Priority-based work queues
- Git-backed storage (committable tasks)
- Multi-project aggregation

**Core Commands:**
```bash
bd ready                    # Show tasks ready to work
bd create "Task title" \
  --type bug \
  --labels security,auth \
  --priority 1 \
  --description "Detailed description"
bd update task-id --status in_progress --assignee AgentName
bd close task-id --reason "Completed"
```

**Workflow Patterns:**

Create well-documented tasks with full context:
```bash
bd create "Fix OAuth authentication timeout" \
  --type bug \
  --labels security,auth,urgent \
  --priority 1 \
  --description "Users experience timeout when logging in via OAuth. Need to investigate token refresh logic and increase timeout threshold." \
  --assignee "AgentName"
```

Set up task dependencies:
```bash
# Create task with dependency
bd create "Add logout button" \
  --type feature \
  --labels ui \
  --priority 2 \
  --deps task-123  # Blocks on auth implementation

# Task won't show in `bd ready` until task-123 is closed
```

Integrate with Agent Mail (use task IDs as thread IDs):
```bash
# Reserve files for task
am-reserve "src/auth/**" --agent AgentName --ttl 3600 --reason "task-123"

# Send progress updates
am-send "[task-123] Progress Update" "Implemented token refresh logic." \
  --from AgentName --thread task-123

# Close task and release
bd close task-123 --reason "Completed"
am-release "src/auth/**" --agent AgentName
```


### 3. Agent Swarm Coordination Commands

**10 slash commands** installed to `~/.claude/commands/agent/` that enable sophisticated multi-agent orchestration:

```
~/.claude/commands/agent/
├── register.md    - Bootstrap agent identity
├── start.md       - Smart task start (context-aware, conflict-free)
├── complete.md    - Finish + verify + auto-continue
├── status.md      - Sync state without starting work
├── handoff.md     - Transfer work with full context
├── pause.md       - Temporarily stop, release resources
├── block.md       - Mark blocked, coordinate with team
├── stop.md        - Smart routing (pause/block/handoff)
├── verify.md      - Quality checks before completion
└── plan.md        - Convert planning docs to Beads tasks
```

#### Command Categories

**Core Workflow (3 commands):**
- `/register` - Bootstrap session (agent identity + task review)
- `/start` - Begin work (context-aware, conflict detection, auto-select)
- `/complete` - Finish work (verify, commit, auto-continue to next)

**Coordination (5 commands):**
- `/status` - Check state, sync with team, update presence
- `/handoff` - Transfer ownership with full context package
- `/pause` - Temporarily stop without completing
- `/block` - Mark blocked, notify team, release resources
- `/stop` - Smart routing based on reason analysis

**Quality & Planning (2 commands):**
- `/verify` - Pre-completion checks (tests, lint, browser, security)
- `/plan` - Convert planning documents to structured Beads tasks

#### How Commands Work

Commands are **markdown files with instructions** that Claude Code executes:
- Located in `~/.claude/commands/agent/`
- Invoked with `/command-name` in Claude Code
- Expand to full prompts with step-by-step coordination logic
- Leverage bash tools (am-*, bd, browser-*) under the hood
- Provide structured output with visual progress indicators

#### Example: Continuous Agent Workflow

**Single agent, continuous flow:**

```bash
# Start session
/register
# → Registers with Agent Mail
# → Reviews available tasks from Beads
# → Shows inbox messages

# Start highest priority task
/start
# → Context-aware: Creates task from conversation if discussed
# → Conflict checks: File locks, git, inbox, task status
# → Reserves files, announces start
# → BEGINS WORKING IMMEDIATELY

# ... work happens (write code, test, document) ...

# Complete and auto-continue
/complete
# → Runs /verify (tests, lint, security)
# → Commits changes, updates docs
# → Releases file reservations
# → Marks task complete in Beads
# → AUTO-STARTS NEXT TASK (continuous flow)

# ... next task starts automatically ...

# Complete and stop for the day
/complete stop
# → Completes current task
# → Shows available tasks but DOESN'T auto-start
# → Agent session ends cleanly
```

**Key insight:** `/complete` creates a **continuous flow** by automatically starting the next highest-priority task. Agents never sit idle!

#### Example: Multi-Agent Coordination

**3 agents working in parallel on a feature:**

```bash
# Agent 1: BlueLake (Backend API)
/register
/start
# → Picks "Build user profile API endpoints" (highest priority)
# → Reserves src/routes/api/profile/**
# → Announces in Agent Mail thread
# ... implements API routes ...
/complete
# → Auto-starts "Add profile validation logic"

# Agent 2: GreenCastle (Frontend UI)
/register
/start
# → Picks "Build profile edit form" (P1, no blockers)
# → Reserves src/routes/account/profile/**
# → Checks: No conflicts with BlueLake's API files
# ... builds Svelte components ...
/block "waiting for API completion"
# → Releases reservations
# → Notifies BlueLake via Agent Mail

# Agent 3: RedMountain (Testing)
/register
/start profile-tests
# → Starts specific task (parallel track)
# → Reserves tests/profile/**
# ... writes integration tests ...
/handoff RedMountain "need E2E expertise"
# → Packages work state (what's done, what remains)
# → Sends comprehensive handoff message
# → Releases reservations

# All agents coordinate via Agent Mail:
# - Thread ID = task ID (e.g., "profile-feature-123")
# - File reservations prevent conflicts
# - Messages enable async collaboration
# - Beads tracks dependencies and completion
```

#### Database & Utility Tools (6)

**Database (4):**
- `db-query` - Execute SQL with automatic safety limits
- `db-connection-test` - Test database connectivity
- `db-schema` - View database schema
- `db-sessions` - Check active database sessions

**Utilities (2):**
- `edge-logs` - View Supabase edge function logs
- `lint-staged` - Lint only staged git files

**All tools have `--help` flags:**
```bash
am-inbox --help
browser-eval.js --help
db-query --help
```

### 5. Optional Tech Stack Tools

During installation, you can select additional **tech-stack-specific tools** via an interactive menu (requires [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)):

#### SvelteKit + Supabase Stack (11 tools)

**Database Schema Tools (3):**
- `error-log` - Query error logs (assumes `error_logs` table)
- `quota-check` - Check AI usage quotas (assumes `ai_usage_logs` table)
- `job-monitor` - Monitor background jobs

**SvelteKit-Specific (2):**
- `component-deps` - Analyze Svelte component dependencies
- `route-list` - List all SvelteKit routes

**Project Development (6):**
- `migration-status` - Check Supabase migration status
- `type-check-fast` - Fast TypeScript type checking
- `build-size` - Analyze bundle sizes
- `cache-clear` - Clear application caches
- `env-check` - Validate environment variables
- `perf-check` - Performance analysis

**When to use stacks:**
- You're using SvelteKit + Supabase + TypeScript
- You want project-specific tooling (schema-aware queries, component analysis)
- You want to avoid duplicating tools across multiple projects with the same stack

**Manual installation:**
```bash
# If you skip during install, you can add stacks later:
bash ~/code/jomarchy-agent-tools/stacks/sveltekit-supabase/install.sh
```

**Documentation:**
See `stacks/sveltekit-supabase/README.md` for detailed stack documentation.

### 6. Global Configuration

**File:** `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

The installer **appends** comprehensive instructions to your global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` file. This "prompt injection" is fully transparent and auditable.

**What gets appended:**
- 🤖 Agent Swarm Coordination Commands (10 slash commands)
- 📬 Agent Mail (coordination patterns, macros, pitfalls)
- 📋 Beads Integration (workflow conventions, task mapping)
- 🛠️ Agent Tools (28 bash tools with examples)

**View the exact content:** [`scripts/setup-global-claude-md.sh`](scripts/setup-global-claude-md.sh#L53-L383) (lines 53-383)

**Automatically loaded by AI assistants in all projects.** This gives every agent access to coordination primitives without consuming your context window.

### 7. Per-Repository Setup

For each git repository in `~/code/*`:

1. **Initializes Beads:**
   - Creates `.beads/` directory
   - Installs git hooks (pre-commit, merge driver)
   - Sets up project-specific issue prefix

2. **Creates/Updates CLAUDE.md:**
   - Project-specific documentation template
   - Agent tools configuration section
   - Quick start guide for AI assistants

**Example scenario: 60 agents fixing 1,231 TypeScript errors in 18 minutes** (via `/start` detecting bulk remediation pattern and deploying agent swarm automatically)

---

## How It Works

### Multi-Project Architecture

Each project gets its own `.beads/` database, while Chimaro's development dashboard aggregates all projects:

```
~/code/
├── project-a/
│   ├── .beads/              # Project A tasks
│   └── CLAUDE.md            # Project A docs
├── project-b/
│   ├── .beads/              # Project B tasks
│   └── CLAUDE.md            # Project B docs
└── chimaro/
    └── /account/development/beads
        # 👆 Unified dashboard showing ALL tasks
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean separation (each project's tasks committable to its repo)
- ✅ Single dashboard view (filter by project, status, priority)
- ✅ Context-aware (`bd` commands work in current project)
- ✅ Visual distinction (color-coded ID badges show project)

### Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Pick work (Beads)
cd ~/code/myproject
bd ready --json          # Shows tasks ready to work

# 2. Register with Agent Mail
am-register --program claude-code --model sonnet-4.5

# 3. Reserve files (prevent conflicts)
am-reserve "src/**/*.ts" \
  --agent AgentName \
  --ttl 3600 \
  --exclusive \
  --reason "task-123: Implementing auth"

# 4. Update task status
bd update task-123 --status in_progress --assignee AgentName

# 5. Announce start (optional - for team coordination)
am-send "[task-123] Starting: Auth implementation" \
  "Working on OAuth flow..." \
  --from AgentName \
  --thread task-123

# 6. Work on code...

# 7. Complete and release
bd close task-123 --reason "Completed: OAuth flow implemented"
am-release "src/**/*.ts" --agent AgentName
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Bash Composability

One of the major advantages of bash tools - pipe, filter, and chain:

```bash
# Chain tools with pipes
am-inbox AgentName --unread --json | jq '.[] | select(.importance=="urgent")'

# Bulk operations
am-inbox AgentName --unread --json | jq -r '.[].id' | \
  xargs -I {} am-ack {} --agent AgentName

# Conditional logic
if am-reservations --agent AgentName | grep -q "src/auth"; then
  echo "Already working on auth"
else
  am-reserve "src/auth/**" --agent AgentName --ttl 3600
fi
```

### Browser Automation

```bash
# Start browser and test UI
browser-start.js --remote-debugging-port 9222
browser-nav.js "http://localhost:3000"
browser-eval.js 'document.querySelector("button").click()'

# Capture screenshot for verification
screenshot=$(browser-screenshot.js)
echo "Screenshot saved: $screenshot"

# Smart waiting (eliminates race conditions)
browser-wait.js --selector ".success-message" --timeout 5000

# Get structured page snapshot (1000x token savings vs screenshots!)
browser-snapshot.js > page-state.json
```

### Git Integration

```bash
# Include task IDs in commits (for traceability)
git commit -m "feat: implement OAuth login (task-123)"

# Pre-commit hook checks reservations automatically (installed by bd init)
```

---

## AI Assistant Integration

### With Claude Code

Claude Code automatically reads `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and project `CLAUDE.md` files.

**No additional configuration needed!**

```bash
# Just start Claude in your project
cd ~/code/myproject
claude-code
```

Claude will:
- See available agent tools
- Know about Beads task management
- Understand Agent Mail coordination
- Follow project-specific patterns

**For any AI coding assistant that supports:**
- Bash command execution
- Slash commands (custom commands via .claude/commands/)
- Reading project-level instruction files

The global CLAUDE.md automatically provides tool documentation to all assistants.


---

## Requirements

- **OS:** Linux or macOS
- **Shell:** Bash
- **Tools:** curl, git
- **Optional:** Node.js (for browser automation tools)
- **Optional:** Chrome/Chromium (for browser testing)

## Unified Dashboard (Chimaro)

If you have Chimaro installed, you get a web-based dashboard that aggregates tasks from all projects:

**URL:** `http://localhost:5173/account/development/beads` (when Chimaro is running)

**Features:**
- View tasks across all ~/code/* projects
- Filter by project, status, priority, assignee, type, labels
- Color-coded ID badges show project at a glance
- Inline editing (update status, priority, assignee)
- Create new tasks via web UI
- Return completed tasks to queue

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Mail Not Running

```bash
# Check status
systemctl --user status agent-mail

# Start manually
systemctl --user start agent-mail

# Enable at boot
systemctl --user enable agent-mail

# Check logs
journalctl --user -u agent-mail -f
```

### Beads Command Not Found

```bash
# Check if bd is in PATH
which bd

# If not found, restart shell
source ~/.bashrc

# Or add to PATH manually
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Tools Not Found

```bash
# Check if tools are symlinked
ls -la ~/.local/bin/am-*

# Re-run symlink setup
bash ~/code/jomarchy-agent-tools/scripts/symlink-tools.sh
```

### Per-Repo Setup Didn't Run

```bash
# Manually run per-repo setup
bash ~/code/jomarchy-agent-tools/scripts/setup-repos.sh
```

## ❓ FAQ

### How is this different from MCP servers?

**Key differences:**

| Feature | JAT (Bash Tools) | MCP Servers |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| **Token cost** | ~400 tokens | 32,000+ tokens |
| **Startup time** | Instant | 2-5 seconds |
| **Composability** | Full bash (pipes, jq, xargs) | Limited |
| **Compatibility** | Universal (any bash-capable assistant) | MCP-specific |
| **Maintenance** | Simple shell scripts | Complex server processes |

**JAT = 80x token reduction with universal compatibility.**

### Will this work with my AI coding assistant?

**Yes, if your assistant supports:**

1. ✅ **Bash command execution** - Can run shell commands
2. ✅ **Custom slash commands** - Supports .claude/commands/ or similar
3. ✅ **Project instruction files** - Reads CLAUDE.md or similar

**Known compatible tools:**
- Claude Code (native integration)
- Cline (bash + slash commands)
- Roo Code (bash + slash commands)
- Continue.dev (bash tools)
- OpenCode (bash + slash commands)
- Any VSCode extension with terminal access
- Any CLI-based assistant (Aider-style)

**Not compatible:**
- Web-only interfaces without bash access
- Assistants that only use API calls (no shell execution)

**The bash tools work everywhere.** MCP integration is optional for advanced features.

### Can I use tools without swarm mode?

**Absolutely!** JAT tools work standalone:

```bash
# Use tools directly without any coordination
db-query "SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10"
am-inbox AgentName --unread
browser-screenshot.js > /tmp/page.png

# Or with simple bash composition
am-inbox AgentName --json | jq '.[] | select(.importance=="urgent")'
```

**You don't need Agent Mail, Beads, or coordination commands to use the 28 tools.**

### How do I coordinate across multiple repositories?

**Agent Mail supports cross-repo coordination:**

**Option A: Shared project key** (same team, different repos)
```bash
# In backend repo
am-register --project "acme-platform"
/start api-authentication

# In frontend repo
am-register --project "acme-platform"  # Same key!
am-inbox Frontend  # Sees messages from backend
```

**Option B: Separate projects** (different teams)
```bash
# Contact handshake between projects
am-contact BackendTeam --from FrontendTeam
# Now they can message each other
```

### What happens if two agents edit the same file?

**File reservations prevent conflicts:**

1. **Agent 1** runs `/start auth-refactor`
   - Reserves `src/auth/**` for 1 hour
   - Works safely

2. **Agent 2** runs `/start auth-tests`
   - Tries to reserve `src/auth/**`
   - Gets `FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT`
   - Either waits or picks different work

**Advisory locks = zero collisions.**

### How do I add custom tools?

**Just add bash scripts to the tools directory:**

```bash
cd ~/code/jomarchy-agent-tools/tools
cat > my-custom-tool <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Your tool logic here
echo "Hello from custom tool"
EOF
chmod +x my-custom-tool

# Now available everywhere
my-custom-tool
```

**JAT auto-discovers any executable in `tools/`.**

### Does this work offline?

**Partially:**

- ✅ **Tools work offline** (db-query, browser-*, local operations)
- ✅ **Beads works offline** (git-backed, no network needed)
- ❌ **Agent Mail requires server** (but can self-host locally)

**Most functionality works without internet.**

### How do I update to the latest version?

```bash
cd ~/code/jomarchy-agent-tools
git pull origin main

# Re-run setup if commands/tools changed
bash scripts/setup-global-claude-md.sh

# Restart Agent Mail if needed
systemctl --user restart agent-mail
```

**Updates are git-pull simple.**

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Agent Mail Server Not Responding

**Symptoms:** Commands timeout, tools fail with connection errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if server is running
systemctl --user status agent-mail

# If not running, start it
systemctl --user start agent-mail

# View logs
journalctl --user -u agent-mail -f

# If still failing, restart
systemctl --user restart agent-mail
```

### FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT Error

**Symptoms:** `/start` or `am-reserve` fails with conflict error

**Cause:** Another agent has locked the files you need

**Solutions:**

1. **Check who has the lock:**
   ```bash
   am-reservations --all
   # Shows: Agent "BackendDev" has src/api/** until 14:30
   ```

2. **Options:**
   - **Wait:** Files auto-release after TTL expires
   - **Work elsewhere:** `/start` picks different task
   - **Coordinate:** `am-send BackendDev "Need src/api/auth.ts"`
   - **Override (last resort):** `am-release src/api/** --force` (if agent is stale)

3. **Prevent conflicts:**
   - Reserve narrower patterns (not `**/*`)
   - Use shorter TTLs (not 24 hours)
   - Coordinate via Agent Mail before starting

### Tools Not in PATH

**Symptoms:** `bash: am-inbox: command not found`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/code/jomarchy-agent-tools/tools:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Verify
which am-inbox
# Should show: /home/user/code/jomarchy-agent-tools/tools/am-inbox
```

### Beads Not Initialized

**Symptoms:** `Error: no beads database found`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Initialize in your project
cd ~/code/your-project
bd init

# Answer prompts:
# - Install git hooks? Y
# - Configure merge driver? Y
```

### Commands Not Working (/start, /register, etc.)

**Symptoms:** `/start` not recognized or does nothing

**Cause:** Commands not installed in `~/.claude/commands/agent/`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Re-run global setup
cd ~/code/jomarchy-agent-tools
bash scripts/setup-global-claude-md.sh

# Verify installation
ls ~/.claude/commands/agent/
# Should show: register.md, start.md, complete.md, etc.
```

### Browser Tools Fail (Chrome Not Found)

**Symptoms:** `browser-start.js` fails with "Chrome not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Linux: Install Chrome/Chromium
sudo apt install chromium-browser  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo pacman -S chromium             # Arch

# macOS: Install Chrome
brew install --cask google-chrome

# Set custom Chrome path
export CHROME_PATH="/path/to/chrome"
```

### Database Connection Errors (db-query fails)

**Symptoms:** `db-query` fails with connection timeout

**Cause:** Missing or invalid DATABASE_URL environment variable

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check current value
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Set in ~/.bashrc or project .env
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db"

# Test connection
db-connection-test
```
