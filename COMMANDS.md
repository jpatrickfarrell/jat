## Core Workflow (4 commands)

### `/agent:start` - Get to Work

**All parameter variations:**
```bash
/agent:start                    # Auto-create new agent (fast!)
/agent:start resume             # Choose from logged-out agents
/agent:start GreatWind          # Resume specific agent by name
/agent:start quick              # Start highest priority task immediately
/agent:start task-abc           # Start specific task (with checks)
/agent:start task-abc quick     # Start specific task (skip checks)
```

**What it does:**
1. Smart registration (auto-create or resume)
2. Session persistence (updates statusline)
3. Task selection (from parameter, context, or priority)
4. Conflict detection (file locks, git, dependencies)
5. Actually starts work (reserves files, sends mail, updates Beads)

### `/agent:next` - Drive Mode (Auto-Continue)

**Usage:**
```bash
/agent:next                     # Full verify + commit + auto-start next
/agent:next quick               # Quick commit + auto-start next (skip verify)
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Verify task (tests, lint, security) - unless quick mode
- ✅ Commit changes
- ✅ Acknowledge all unread Agent Mail
- ✅ Announce completion
- ✅ Mark task complete in Beads
- ✅ Release file locks
- ✅ **Auto-start highest priority task** (continuous flow)

**When to use:**
- Flow state / drive mode
- Sprint work
- High velocity

---

### `/agent:complete` - Finish Properly (Manual Selection)

**Usage:**
```bash
/agent:complete                 # Full verify + show menu + recommended next
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Verify task (tests, lint, security, browser)
- ✅ Commit changes
- ✅ Acknowledge all unread Agent Mail
- ✅ Announce completion
- ✅ Mark task complete in Beads
- ✅ Release file locks
- ✅ **Show available tasks menu**
- ✅ **Display recommended next task** (you choose)

**Output includes:**
```
✅ Task Completed: jat-abc "Add user settings"
👤 Agent: GreatWind

📋 Recommended Next Task:
   → jat-xyz "Update documentation" (Priority: P1)

   Type: /agent:start jat-xyz
```

**When to use:**
- Want to choose next task manually
- Context switch needed
- Review point
- End of work (before closing terminal)

---

### `/agent:pause` - Quick Pivot (Context Switch)

**Usage:**
```bash
/agent:pause                    # Quick exit + show menu
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Quick commit/stash (always fast, no verification)
- ✅ Acknowledge all unread Agent Mail
- ✅ Send pause notification
- ✅ Mark task as incomplete (keeps in_progress)
- ✅ Release file locks
- ✅ **Show available tasks menu** (to pivot)

**When to use:**
- Emergency exit (laptop dying)
- Pivot to different work
- Blocked / can't continue
- Context switch

```

**What it checks:**
- Tests (runs test suite)

- Breaks work into atomic, testable tasks
- Creates Beads tasks with proper dependency chains
- Sets priorities (P0 = foundation, P1 = features, P2 = polish)

## Common Workflows

### Drive Mode (Continuous Flow)
```bash
/agent:start                    # Create agent
/agent:start task-abc           # Start first task
/agent:next                     # Complete + auto-start next
/agent:next                     # Complete + auto-start next
/agent:next                     # Complete + auto-start next
# ... continuous loop, never stops ...
```

### Manual Mode (Careful Selection)
```bash
/agent:start                    # Create agent
/agent:start task-abc           # Start task
/agent:complete                 # Complete + show menu
# Review recommendations...
/agent:start task-xyz           # Pick manually
/agent:complete                 # Complete + show menu
# ... controlled workflow ...
```

### Quick Pivot (Context Switch)
```bash
/agent:start task-ui-123        # Working on UI
# Got stuck, need to switch...
/agent:pause                    # Quick exit + show menu
/agent:start task-bug-456       # Switch to different work
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```bash
# Terminal 1: Frontend (drive mode)
/agent:start
/agent:start task-ui-123
/agent:next                     # Auto-continues

# Terminal 2: Backend (manual)
/agent:start resume             # Choose logged-out agent
/agent:start task-api-456
/agent:complete                 # Manual control

# Terminal 3: QA (quick pivot)
/agent:start
/agent:start task-test-789
/agent:pause                    # Switch to urgent bug
/agent:start task-hotfix-001
```

## Quick Tips

**Speed:**
- Use `/agent:start quick` for immediate task start (no checks)
- Use `/agent:next quick` for rapid iteration (no verification)

**Control:**
- Use `/agent:complete` when you want to choose next task
- Use `/agent:pause` for emergency exits or context switches

**Quality:**
- Always run `/agent:verify` before `/agent:complete` for critical work
- Let `/agent:next` handle verification automatically (default mode)

**Coordination:**
- All commands acknowledge Agent Mail (stay synchronized)
- All commands announce completion (team visibility)
- File reservations prevent conflicts automatically
