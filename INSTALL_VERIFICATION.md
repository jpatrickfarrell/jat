  2. Install Beads CLI
  3. Symlink generic tools
  4. Optional tech stack tools (with gum)
  5. Setup global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
  6. Setup repositories
- ✅ Clear output with color-coded sections
- ✅ Comprehensive "next steps" instructions

**Recommendation:** No changes needed

### 5. Documentation Accuracy

**Files Reviewed:**
- `README.md`
- `install.sh` (inline documentation)
- Installation output messages

**Findings:**

✅ **Installation Instructions:** Accurate and complete
- One-line install command provided
- PATH configuration documented
- Troubleshooting section included

✅ **Next Steps:** Clear and actionable
1. Ensure ~/.local/bin is in PATH
2. Restart shell
3. Test Agent Mail: `am-whoami --agent TestAgent`
4. Test Beads: `cd ~/code/<project> && bd ready`
5. Test tools: `am-register --help`

✅ **Architecture Documentation:** Comprehensive
- Explains "what" and "why"
- Clear benefits listed
- Workflow examples provided

**Minor Observation:**
- Documentation mentions 28 generic tools but verification only checked core tools
- Recommendation: Add tool count breakdown to README (11 Agent Mail + 1 Beads + X generic = 28 total)

---

## Identified Issues

### None (Critical or Major)

### Minor Observations

1. **Tool Count Documentation**
   - Issue: README claims "28 generic bash tools" but breakdown unclear
   - Impact: Low - tools work, just documentation clarity
   - Recommendation: Add explicit list or breakdown in README

2. **Beads Tasks Already Complete**
   - Issue: Tasks jomarchy-agent-tools-3d4 and jomarchy-agent-tools-hug described building tools that already exist
   - Impact: None - tools exist and work
   - Action: Tasks were closed during verification

---

## Dependencies Verified

### Required
- ✅ bash (shell scripting)
- ✅ sqlite3 (Agent Mail database)
- ✅ git (installation from GitHub)
- ✅ Node.js (for query layer tests)
- ✅ npm (for better-sqlite3)

### Optional
- gum (interactive stack selection) - Not required for core functionality
- Tech stack tools (SvelteKit+Supabase) - Optional installation

### Node Packages
- ✅ better-sqlite3@11.10.0 (installed and working)

---

## Performance Metrics

**Test Execution Times:**
- Agent Mail workflow test: ~2 seconds
- Beads query layer test: ~1 second
- Agent Mail query layer test: ~1 second
- Tool accessibility check: <1 second

**Total Verification Time:** ~5 seconds

**Query Performance:**
- 451 tasks across 3 projects: sub-second
- 12 agents queried: instant
- FTS5 search: instant

---

## Fresh Install Simulation

**Scenario:** New user clones repo and runs install.sh

**Expected Flow:**
1. Clone from GitHub → ✅ Documented
2. Run install.sh → ✅ Working
3. Install Agent Mail → ✅ 11 tools installed
4. Install Beads → ✅ bd command working
5. Symlink tools → ✅ All accessible from PATH
6. Optional stacks → ✅ Skippable with gum or manual
7. Setup global CLAUDE.md → ✅ Configured
8. Setup repos → ✅ Per-repo setup

**Potential Blockers for New Users:**
- **PATH configuration:** Users must add ~/.local/bin to PATH manually
  - Mitigation: Clear instructions in install output and README
- **Node.js/npm:** Required for query layers
  - Mitigation: Document in README dependencies section

**Recommendation:** Add "Prerequisites" section to README listing:
- bash 4.0+
- sqlite3
- git
- Node.js 14+ (for query layers)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority
None - installation is production-ready

### Medium Priority
1. **Add Prerequisites Section to README**
   - List: bash, sqlite3, git, Node.js, npm
   - Include version requirements
   - Add installation links for each

2. **Document Tool Breakdown**
   - Clarify "28 tools" claim
   - List categories: Agent Mail (11), Beads (1), Query Layers (2), Generic (?), Stack-specific (optional)

### Low Priority
1. **Add Installation Video/GIF**
   - Show one-line install in action
   - Demonstrate first workflow
   - Could increase adoption

2. **Create QUICKSTART.md**
   - 5-minute "hello world" tutorial
   - From installation to first agent coordination
   - Complement existing README

---

## Conclusion

**Verdict:** ✅ **VERIFIED - PRODUCTION READY**

The jomarchy-agent-tools installation is robust, well-tested, and ready for new users. All critical components work correctly:

- ✅ 17/17 core tools accessible
- ✅ 100% test pass rate (3 comprehensive test suites)
- ✅ Documentation accurate and helpful
- ✅ Multi-project support working
- ✅ Performance excellent
- ✅ No critical issues found

**Confidence Level:** Very High

New users can successfully install and use jomarchy-agent-tools by following the existing documentation. The system handles edge cases well (conflict detection, error handling) and provides clear feedback.
