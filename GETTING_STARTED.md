# Getting Started with JAT

**Get a multi-agent dashboard running in 5 minutes.**

JAT (Jomarchy Agent Tools) lets you coordinate multiple AI coding agents working in parallel on your codebase. The dashboard is your command center.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install JAT

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joewinke/jat/main/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 2. Add Your Projects

JAT needs to know about your projects. By default, it scans `~/code/`:

```bash
jat init                    # Auto-discover projects in ~/code/
```

**Custom project paths?** Edit `~/.config/jat/projects.json`:
```json
{
  "projects": {
    "my-app": {
      "name": "MY-APP",
      "path": "~/projects/my-app",
      "port": 3000
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Launch the Dashboard

```bash
jat-dashboard               # Opens http://localhost:5173 (or configured port)
```

You'll see:
- **Tasks page** - Your backlog across all projects
- **Work page** - Active agent sessions
- **Agents page** - Agent status and coordination

### 4. Create Your First Task

In the dashboard:
1. Click **"+ New Task"**
2. Enter a title and description
3. Set priority (P0 = critical, P2 = normal)
4. Click **Create**

Or via CLI:
```bash
cd ~/code/my-project
bd create "Add user authentication" --priority 1 --type feature
```

### 5. Launch an Agent

```bash
jat my-project              # Launches: VS Code + Claude + Dashboard
# OR
jat my-project --claude     # Claude only (faster)
# OR
jat-myproject               # Shortcut function (generated by install)
```

The agent:
1. Runs inside **tmux** (required for dashboard tracking)
2. Auto-runs `/jat:start`
3. Shows available tasks
4. You pick a task, agent starts working

### 6. Watch the Magic

In the dashboard **Work** page, you'll see:
- Agent status (working, needs input, ready for review)
- Current task progress
- Real-time signals from agents
- EventStack timeline of agent activity

---

## Launch a Swarm (Multiple Agents)

```bash
jat my-project 4            # Launch 4 Claude sessions
jat my-project 4 --auto     # 4 agents that auto-pick tasks
```

Each agent:
- Gets assigned different tasks (no conflicts)
- Reserves files to prevent collisions
- Coordinates via Agent Mail
- Reports status to dashboard

---

## Key Concepts

### One Agent = One Session = One Task

Each Claude session handles exactly one task. When complete:
1. Run `/jat:complete`
2. Session ends
3. Spawn new agent for next task

This keeps context clean and focused.

### Task Flow

```
Create task (dashboard/CLI)
       ↓
Agent picks task (/jat:start)
       ↓
Agent works (code, test, document)
       ↓
Agent signals review
       ↓
You approve → /jat:complete
       ↓
Task closed, agent session ends
       ↓
Next task → spawn new agent
```

### Beads Task Sync

Tasks live in `.beads/issues.jsonl` and sync via git:
- You commit → tasks sync to repo
- Teammate pulls → they see your tasks
- Shared backlog across the team

## Common Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `jat-dashboard` | Launch dashboard |
| `jat <project>` | Full dev environment |
| `jat <project> --claude` | Claude only |
| `jat <project> 4` | Launch 4 agents |
| `jat list` | Show all projects |
| `jat init` | Auto-discover projects |
| `bd ready` | Show tasks ready to work |
| `bd create "Title"` | Create a task |

---

## Tmux Requirement

**Agents MUST run in tmux for dashboard tracking.**

The `jat` command handles this automatically. If you see "NOT IN TMUX SESSION" in the statusline, exit and use `jat <project>` instead of running Claude directly.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create some tasks** in the dashboard
2. **Launch an agent** with `jat <project>`
3. **Watch the Work page** as agent progresses
4. **Try `/jat:complete`** when agent is done

For full documentation, see [README.md](./README.md).

---

## Troubleshooting

**Dashboard won't start?**
```bash
cd ~/code/jat/dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Agent shows offline?**
- Not running in tmux. Use `jat <project>` to launch properly.

**Custom project path?**
- Edit `~/.config/jat/projects.json` manually (see step 2 above)

**Tasks not syncing?**
- Commit `.beads/issues.jsonl` to git
- Teammate pulls to get updates
