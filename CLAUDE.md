## Session-Aware Statusline

**The statusline automatically displays your agent identity and status for each Claude Code session.**

### How It Works

Each Claude Code session has a unique `session_id`. The statusline uses this to track agent identity independently per session:

```
Session 1: FreeMarsh  | [P1] task-abc - Building dashboard [🔒2 📬1 ⏱45m]
Session 2: PaleStar   | idle [📬3]
Session 3: StrongShore | [P0] task-xyz - Critical bug fix [🔒1]
```

### Registration

When you run `/agent:start`, it automatically:
1. Registers your agent in Agent Mail
2. Writes agent name to `.claude/agent-{session_id}.txt`
3. Statusline reads from that file and displays your identity

**No manual setup needed** - just run a command and the statusline updates!

### What the Statusline Shows

**Format:** `AgentName | [Priority] Task ID - Task Title [Indicators]`

**Indicators:**
- 🔒N - Active file reservations
- 📬N - Unread messages in inbox
- ⏱Xm/Xh - Time until lock expires
- N% - Task progress (if tracked)

**Examples:**
```
FreeMarsh | [P1] jat-m95 - Update /start... [🔒2 📬1 ⏱45m]
FreeMarsh | idle [📬3]
jat | no agent registered
```

### Multi-Agent Sessions

**Run as many agents as you want simultaneously!** Each session maintains its own identity:

```bash
# Terminal 1
/agent:start  # Choose FreeMarsh
# Statusline shows: FreeMarsh | ...

# Terminal 2
/agent:start  # Choose PaleStar
# Statusline shows: PaleStar | ...

# Terminal 3
/agent:start  # Choose StrongShore
# Statusline shows: StrongShore | ...
```

All three sessions work independently with their own agent identities.

### Files Created

- `.claude/agent-{session_id}.txt` - Your agent name for this session
- `/tmp/claude-session-${PPID}.txt` - PPID-based session ID (process-isolated)
- `.claude/statusline.sh` - The statusline script

**These files are session-specific** - don't commit `agent-*.txt` files to git (they're per-developer session).

### Status Calculation Algorithm

**How the statusline determines what to display:**

The statusline follows a priority-based decision tree to determine agent status:

```
┌─ STATUS CALCULATION DECISION TREE ─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                        │
│  1. Check if agent is registered                                      │
│     └─ NO → Show "jat | no agent registered"                          │
│     └─ YES → Continue to step 2                                       │
│                                                                        │
│  2. Check Beads for in_progress tasks assigned to agent               │
│     └─ FOUND → Use task from Beads (Priority 1 source)                │
│     └─ NOT FOUND → Continue to step 3                                 │
│                                                                        │
│  3. Check file reservations for task ID in reason field               │
│     └─ FOUND → Extract task ID, lookup in Beads (Priority 2 source)   │
│     └─ NOT FOUND → Continue to step 4                                 │
│                                                                        │
│  4. No active task found                                              │
│     └─ Show "AgentName | idle"                                        │
│                                                                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Priority Order (what's checked first):**

1. **Agent Registration** - `.claude/agent-{session_id}.txt` exists?
2. **Beads in_progress** - `bd list --json | filter(assignee == agent && status == "in_progress")`
3. **File Reservations** - `am-reservations --agent X | extract task ID from reason`
4. **Idle State** - Agent registered but no work

**Why this order matters:**

- **Beads is source of truth** - If Beads says task is `in_progress`, show it (even without reservations)
- **Reservations are fallback** - If agent has reservations but forgot to update Beads
- **Prevents false "idle"** - Agent working but statusline shows idle is confusing

**Edge Cases Handled:**

1. **Task closed but reservation still active**
   - Shows task from reservation (statusline doesn't check task status)
   - `/agent:start` smart cleanup will release stale reservations

2. **Multiple in_progress tasks**
   - Shows first task returned by Beads (should not happen in normal workflow)

3. **Reservation without task ID in reason**
   - Shows idle (can't extract task ID to lookup)

4. **Session file missing but agent registered globally**
   - Shows "no agent registered" (session-specific, not global)

**Indicator Colors (dynamic thresholds):**

```
🔒 File Locks:
  - Cyan (1-2 locks)    - Normal load
  - Yellow (3-5 locks)  - Moderate load
  - Red (>5 locks)      - Heavy load

📬 Unread Messages:
  - Cyan (1-5 msgs)     - Few messages
  - Yellow (6-15 msgs)  - Moderate backlog
  - Red (>15 msgs)      - Needs attention

⏱ Time Remaining:
  - Green (>30 min)     - Plenty of time
  - Yellow (10-30 min)  - Mid-way
  - Red (<10 min)       - About to expire

📊 Task Progress:
  - Red (<25%)          - Just started
  - Yellow (25-75%)     - In progress
  - Green (>75%)        - Almost done
```

**Examples for Each Status State:**

```
# 1. No agent registered
jat | no agent registered

# 2. Agent registered, no work
GreatLake | idle [📬3]

# 3. Active task from Beads (in_progress)
GreatLake | [P1] jat-va3 - Document statusline... [🔒2 📬26 ⏱45m]

# 4. Active task from file reservation (fallback)
GreatLake | [P0] jat-abc - Critical bug fix [🔒1 ⏱15m]

# 5. Multiple indicators (full status)
RichPrairie | [P1] jat-xyz - Feature work [🔒3 📬12 ⏱8m 65%]
              └─ Yellow locks, yellow messages, red time, yellow progress
```

**Where the Logic Lives:**

- **Statusline**: `.claude/statusline.sh` (lines 210-400)
  - Session-specific agent identity
  - Status calculation decision tree
  - Indicator color thresholds

- **Dashboard**: `dashboard/src/routes/api/agents/+server.js`
  - Uses same logic via `getAgentStatus()` function
  - Shared algorithm prevents drift

**Code Reference:**

```bash
# Priority 1: Check Beads for in_progress tasks
# .claude/statusline.sh:226-238
task_json=$(bd list --json | jq -r --arg agent "$agent_name" \
    '.[] | select(.assignee == $agent and .status == "in_progress")')

# Priority 2: Fall back to file reservations
# .claude/statusline.sh:242-263
reservation_info=$(am-reservations --agent "$agent_name")
task_id=$(echo "$reservation_info" | grep -oE 'jat-[a-z0-9]{3}')
```

**Troubleshooting:**

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Shows "idle" but I'm working | Task not marked `in_progress` in Beads | Run `bd update task-id --status in_progress` |
| Shows wrong task | Old reservation from previous task | Release stale reservation with `am-release` |
| Shows "no agent registered" | Session file missing | Run `/agent:start` to register |
| Indicator count seems wrong | Cached data, stale reservations | Wait 1 min for statusline refresh |

### Why PPID-Based Session Tracking?

**The Problem: Race Conditions with Shared Files**

Initially, we used a shared file `.claude/current-session-id.txt` that all Claude Code instances would read/write. This caused race conditions:

```bash
# Terminal 1 (FreeMarsh) writes session ID
echo "session-abc" > .claude/current-session-id.txt

# Terminal 2 (PaleStar) writes IMMEDIATELY after
echo "session-xyz" > .claude/current-session-id.txt  # Overwrites!

# Terminal 1 tries to read its session ID
cat .claude/current-session-id.txt  # Gets "session-xyz" - WRONG!
```

**The Solution: PPID-Based Process Isolation**

Each Claude Code session runs in a unique process with its own Parent Process ID (PPID). We use this for isolation:

```bash
# Terminal 1: PPID = 12345
/tmp/claude-session-12345.txt → "session-abc"

# Terminal 2: PPID = 67890
/tmp/claude-session-67890.txt → "session-xyz"

# No conflicts! Each process has its own file.
```

**File Lifecycle:**
- **Creation**: Statusline creates `/tmp/claude-session-${PPID}.txt` on first render
- **Updates**: Statusline updates the file on every render (writes current session ID)
- **Cleanup**: OS automatically deletes `/tmp` files when process exits
- **Location**: `/tmp` (not `.claude/`) because it's process-specific, not project-specific

**Multiple Terminals Example:**

```bash
# Terminal 1 (PPID: 12345)
/tmp/claude-session-12345.txt → "a019c84c..."
.claude/agent-a019c84c....txt → "FreeMarsh"

# Terminal 2 (PPID: 67890)
/tmp/claude-session-67890.txt → "9b2a2fac..."
.claude/agent-9b2a2fac....txt → "PaleStar"

# Each terminal has independent session tracking - no race conditions!
```

### Troubleshooting Statusline Issues

**Problem: Statusline shows wrong agent name or different session's agent**

This happens when multiple Claude Code sessions are running and you need to update your current session's identity.

**❌ This does NOT work:**
```bash
# Environment variables don't persist to statusline
export AGENT_NAME=ShortTundra
am-register --name ShortTundra ...
```

**✅ This DOES work - write to your session file:**
```bash
# Get your session ID (PPID-based)
session_id=$(cat /tmp/claude-session-${PPID}.txt 2>/dev/null | tr -d '\n')

# Write your agent name to YOUR session's file
echo "ShortTundra" > ".claude/agent-${session_id}.txt"
```

**One-liner fix:**
```bash
session_id=$(cat /tmp/claude-session-${PPID}.txt | tr -d '\n') && echo "ShortTundra" > ".claude/agent-${session_id}.txt"
```

Your statusline updates immediately - no restart needed!

**Why this works:**
- Each Claude Code session has a unique `session_id` (e.g., `abc123`)
- The statusline reads from `.claude/agent-{your-session-id}.txt`
- Other sessions have their own files (`.claude/agent-{other-id}.txt`)
- `export AGENT_NAME=` only affects bash subprocesses, not the statusline process
- Writing to the session file is the only way to update the statusline

**Checking which session you're in:**
```bash
# See your session ID (PPID-based)
cat /tmp/claude-session-${PPID}.txt

# See your PPID (parent process ID)
echo $PPID

# See all session files for this project
ls -la .claude/agent-*.txt

# See your session's agent name
session_id=$(cat /tmp/claude-session-${PPID}.txt | tr -d '\n') && cat ".claude/agent-${session_id}.txt"
```

## Agent Workflow Commands

**All agent commands are in `./commands/agent/` and available via `/agent:*` namespace.**

### Command Overview

| Command | Purpose | Size |
|---------|---------|------|
| `/agent:start` | **Begin work** - register + task start | 33K |
| `/agent:next` | **Drive mode** - complete + auto-start next | 24K |
| `/agent:complete` | **Finish properly** - complete + show menu | 26K |
| `/agent:pause` | **Quick pivot** - pause + show menu | 22K |
| `/agent:status` | Check current work status | 21K |
| `/agent:verify` | Verify task completion | 29K |
| `/agent:plan` | Plan work strategy | 27K |

### `/agent:start` - Get to Work Command

**The main command** - handles registration, task selection, conflict detection, and actually starts work.

**Usage:**
```bash
/agent:start                    # Auto-create agent, show tasks
/agent:start resume             # Choose from logged-out agents
/agent:start AgentName          # Resume specific agent
/agent:start task-abc           # Start specific task
/agent:start quick              # Start highest priority immediately
/agent:start task-abc quick     # Start task, skip checks
```

**What it does:**
1. **Smart Registration:** Auto-creates new agent by default; `resume` shows logged-out agents only
2. **Session Persistence:** Updates `.claude/agent-{session_id}.txt` for statusline
3. **Task Selection:** From parameter, conversation context, or priority
4. **Conflict Detection:** File locks, git changes, dependencies
5. **Actually Starts Work:** Reserves files, sends Agent Mail, updates Beads

**Key behaviors:**

**Default (no params):**
- Auto-creates new agent immediately (fast!)
- Shows available tasks
- Use this 90% of the time

**Resume mode:**
```bash
/agent:start resume
```
- Shows ONLY logged-out agents (no active sessions)
- Filters out agents currently working in other terminals
- Choose existing agent or create new

**Specific agent:**
```bash
/agent:start JustGrove
```
- Resume as specific agent by name
- Shows tasks for that agent

**Quick mode:**
```bash
/agent:start quick
```
- Auto-picks highest priority task
- Skips conflict checks
- Starts immediately
### `/agent:next` - Drive Mode (Auto-Continue)

**Complete current task and immediately start the next one.** For high-velocity work.

**Usage:**
```bash
/agent:next              # Complete + auto-start (full verification)
/agent:next quick        # Complete + auto-start (skip verification)
```

**What it does:**
1. Full verification (unless quick): tests, lint, security
2. Commit changes
3. Acknowledge all unread Agent Mail
4. Announce completion
5. Mark task complete in Beads
6. Release file locks
7. **Auto-start highest priority task** (no menu, no pause)

**When to use:**
- Flow state / drive mode
- Sprint work
- High velocity

### `/agent:complete` - Finish Properly

**Complete current task with full verification, then show menu.** For careful workflow.

**Usage:**
```bash
/agent:complete          # Complete + show menu
```

**What it does:**
1. Full verification: tests, lint, security, browser
2. Commit changes
3. Acknowledge all unread Agent Mail
4. Announce completion
5. Mark task complete in Beads
6. Release file locks
7. **Show available tasks menu**
8. **Display recommended next task** (you choose)

**Output includes:**
```
✅ Task Completed: jat-abc "Add user settings"
👤 Agent: JustGrove

📋 Recommended Next Task:
   → jat-xyz "Update documentation" (Priority: P1)

   Type: /agent:start jat-xyz
```

**When to use:**
- Want to choose next task manually
- Context switch needed
- Review point
- End of work (before closing terminal)

### `/agent:pause` - Quick Pivot

**Pause current task and show menu to pivot to different work.**

**Usage:**
```bash
/agent:pause             # Pause + show menu
```

**What it does:**
1. Quick commit/stash (always fast, no verification)
2. Acknowledge all unread Agent Mail
3. Send pause notification
4. Mark task as incomplete (keeps in_progress)
5. Release file locks
6. **Show available tasks menu** (to pivot)

**When to use:**
- Emergency exit (laptop dying)
- Pivot to different work
- Blocked / can't continue
- Context switch

### Other Agent Commands

**`/agent:status`** - Check what you're working on
```bash
/agent:status    # Shows current task, locks, messages
```

**`/agent:plan`** - Plan work strategy
```bash
/agent:plan     # Strategic planning for complex work
```

**`/agent:verify`** - Verify task completion
```bash
/agent:verify task-abc    # Verify all acceptance criteria met
```

### Command Workflow Recommendations

**Drive Mode (Auto-Continue):**
```bash
# Morning
/agent:start              # Create agent, see tasks

# Work loop (auto-continues)
/agent:start task-abc     # Start task
[work]
/agent:next               # Complete + auto-start next
[work]
/agent:next               # Complete + auto-start next
[work]
/agent:next               # Complete + auto-start next

# End of day
/agent:complete           # Complete + show menu, close terminal
```

**Careful Mode (Manual Selection):**
```bash
# When you want control
/agent:start
[work on task]
/agent:complete           # Complete + show menu
# Review available tasks...
/agent:start task-xyz     # Pick manually
```

**Quick Pivot:**
```bash
# Working on frontend, need to switch to backend bug
/agent:start task-ui-123
[work... got stuck]
/agent:pause              # Pause + show menu
/agent:start task-bug-456 # Switch to different work
```

**Multi-Agent Coordination:**
```bash
# Terminal 1 (Frontend - drive mode)
/agent:start
/agent:start task-ui-123
[work]
/agent:next               # Auto-continues

# Terminal 2 (Backend - manual)
/agent:start resume       # Choose logged-out agent
/agent:start task-api-456
[work]
/agent:complete           # Manual control
```

**Troubleshooting:**
```bash
# Statusline shows "no agent registered"?
/agent:start              # Quick fix

# Want detailed status review?
/agent:status             # Full status

# Need to stop quickly (laptop dying)?
/agent:pause              # Quick exit

# Done for the day?
/agent:complete           # Show menu, close terminal

# Want to manually choose next task?
/agent:complete           # Shows menu + recommended
```

## Dashboard Development

**The Beads Task Dashboard is a SvelteKit 5 application in the `dashboard/` directory.**

### Important: Dashboard-Specific Documentation

When working on the dashboard, refer to:
```
dashboard/CLAUDE.md
```

This contains critical information about:
- **Tailwind CSS v4 syntax** (completely different from v3!)
- DaisyUI theme configuration
- Theme switching implementation
- Svelte 5 runes syntax
- Common pitfalls and troubleshooting

### Quick Dashboard Commands

**Launcher Script (Recommended):**
```bash
# Launch dashboard from anywhere
bd-dashboard        # Checks dependencies, starts server, opens browser
jat-dashboard       # Alias for bd-dashboard

# What it does:
# - Checks for node_modules, runs npm install if needed
# - Starts dev server on http://127.0.0.1:5174
# - Opens browser automatically after 3 seconds
```

**Manual Commands:**
```bash
cd dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (usually http://127.0.0.1:5174)
npm run dev

# Clean build cache if themes aren't loading
rm -rf .svelte-kit node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```

### ⚠️ Critical Dashboard Issue: Tailwind v4

The dashboard uses **Tailwind CSS v4**, which has completely different syntax:

**❌ This does NOT work (v3 syntax):**
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

**✅ You MUST use this (v4 syntax):**
```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@plugin "daisyui" {
  themes: light, dark, nord --default, ...;
}
```

See `dashboard/CLAUDE.md` for full details.

## Agent Mail Tools

For multi-agent coordination. See `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for full Agent Mail documentation.

**Quick Reference:**
```bash
# Register agent
# RECOMMENDED: Use /agent:start (automatically updates statusline!)
# Or manually: am-register --name AgentName --program claude-code --model sonnet-4.5

# Reserve files
am-reserve "src/**/*.ts" --agent AgentName --ttl 3600 --exclusive --reason "task-abc"

# Send messages
# Basic messaging
am-send "Subject" "Body" --from Agent1 --to Agent2 --thread task-abc

# Broadcast messaging (multi-agent)
am-send "Update" "Status" --from Dev --to @active --importance high                    # Active agents (last 60 min)
am-send "Urgent" "Need help" --from Dev --to @active --active-window 15 --importance urgent  # Custom window (15 min)
am-send "Team sync" "Sprint done" --from Lead --to @project:jat                        # All agents in project
am-send "Critical" "System down" --from Monitor --to @all --importance urgent          # ALL agents (even offline)
am-send "Review needed" "PR ready" --from Dev --to @active,SeniorDev                   # Mixed (broadcast + specific)

# Check inbox
am-inbox AgentName --unread                                         # Only unread messages
am-inbox AgentName --unread --hide-acked                            # Cleanest view (filters acknowledged broadcasts)
am-inbox AgentName --hide-acked --thread task-abc                   # Unacked messages in specific thread
```

### Broadcast Messaging: Examples and Best Practices

Agent Mail supports broadcast messaging for multi-agent coordination. See `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for comprehensive broadcast documentation.

**Quick Examples:**

**1. Deploy coordination:**
```bash
am-send "Deploy: T-5min" \
  "Deployment starting in 5min. Pause work." \
  --from DeployBot --to @active --active-window 30 --importance urgent --ttl 600 --ack-required
```

**2. Project announcement:**
```bash
am-send "Feature ready" \
  "New API available in feature/user-auth branch." \
  --from Lead --to @project:jat --thread feature-user-auth
```

**3. Urgent all-hands:**
```bash
am-send "URGENT: Production down" \
  "All agents pause work immediately." \
  --from Monitor --to @all --importance urgent --ack-required --thread incident-2025
```

**4. Standup (short window):**
```bash
am-send "Standup in 5min" \
  "Daily standup starting soon." \
  --from Scrum --to @active --active-window 15 --ttl 600
```

**5. PR review (mixed recipients):**
```bash
am-send "PR review needed" \
  "Critical fix ready for review." \
  --from Dev --to @active,SeniorDev --thread pr-1234 --ack-required
```

**6. Checking and acknowledging:**
```bash
# Clean inbox view (hide acknowledged broadcasts)
am-inbox AgentName --unread --hide-acked

# Acknowledge broadcast
am-ack MSG_ID --agent AgentName

# Batch acknowledge all unread
am-inbox AgentName --unread --json | jq -r '.[].id' | xargs -I {} am-ack {} --agent AgentName
```

**Best Practices Summary:**
- **@active** for time-sensitive coordination (deployments, incidents)
- **@project:name** for project-specific updates
- **@all** only for critical system-wide alerts (use sparingly)
- Set appropriate TTLs: short (300-600s) for immediate, long (3600s+) for extended
- Use --ack-required for critical messages requiring confirmation
- Combine with thread_id for context and conversation tracking
- Use --active-window to control recipient freshness (default: 60 min)

**Common Patterns:**
```bash
# Deployment: Before, during, after
am-send "Deploy: T-5min" "..." --to @active --ttl 600 --ack-required
am-send "Deploy: In progress" "..." --to @active --thread deploy-X
am-send "Deploy: Complete" "..." --to @active --thread deploy-X

# Incident: Alert, updates, resolution
am-send "INCIDENT: DB down" "..." --to @all --ack-required --thread incident-X
am-reply MSG_ID "Update: investigating" --agent Lead
am-send "RESOLVED: DB restored" "..." --to @all --thread incident-X

# Handoff: Notify active + specific expert
am-send "Handoff needed" "..." --to @active,Expert --thread task-123
```

## Beads Command Cheat Sheet

**Quick reference for agents to avoid common command errors.**

### Core Commands

```bash
# Task creation and management
bd create "Title" --type task --priority 1 --description "..."
bd list --status open                   # List tasks
bd ready --json                         # Get ready tasks
bd show task-abc                        # Task details
bd update task-abc --status in_progress --assignee AgentName
bd close task-abc --reason "Completed"
```

### Dependency Management

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT ways to add dependencies
bd create "Task" --deps task-xyz        # During creation
bd dep add task-abc task-xyz            # After creation (abc depends on xyz)

# View dependencies
bd dep tree task-abc                    # What task-abc depends on
bd dep tree task-abc --reverse          # What depends on task-abc
bd dep cycles                           # Find circular dependencies

# Remove dependency
bd dep remove task-abc task-xyz
```

### Common Mistakes

```bash
# ❌ WRONG                              # ✅ CORRECT
bd add task-abc --depends xyz           bd dep add task-abc xyz
bd update task-abc --depends xyz        bd dep add task-abc xyz
bd tree task-abc                        bd dep tree task-abc
bd update task-abc --status in-progress bd update task-abc --status in_progress
```

### Status Values

Use **underscores** not hyphens:
- `open` - Available to start
- `in_progress` - Currently being worked on (NOT `in-progress`)
- `blocked` - Waiting on something
- `closed` - Completed

### Integration Pattern

```bash
# 1. Pick work
bd ready --json | jq -r '.[0].id'      # Get highest priority task

# 2. Start work
bd update task-abc --status in_progress --assignee $AGENT_NAME
am-reserve "src/**/*.ts" --agent $AGENT_NAME --reason "task-abc"

# 3. Complete work
bd close task-abc --reason "Implemented feature"
am-release "src/**/*.ts" --agent $AGENT_NAME
```

## Integration with Beads

Use Beads issue IDs (e.g., `task-abc`) as:
- Agent Mail `thread_id`
- File reservation `reason`
- Commit message references

```bash
# Example workflow
bd ready --json                                         # Pick work
/agent:start task-abc                                   # Registers + starts task
# ... do work ...
/agent:complete task-abc                                # Closes task
```

## Common Issues

### Dashboard themes not working
1. Check `dashboard/src/app.css` uses Tailwind v4 syntax
2. See `dashboard/CLAUDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting

### Agent Mail "not registered"
```bash
/agent:start              # Quick fix (auto-registers)
# Or manually:
am-register --name YourAgentName --program claude-code --model sonnet-4.5
```

### Browser tools not found
```bash
cd /home/jw/code/jat
./install.sh
```

### Fresh dashboard build needed
```bash
cd dashboard
rm -rf .svelte-kit node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```

### Statusline not updating
```bash
# Write to your session file (PPID-based)
session_id=$(cat /tmp/claude-session-${PPID}.txt | tr -d '\n') && echo "YourAgentName" > ".claude/agent-${session_id}.txt"
```
