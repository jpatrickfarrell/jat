# JAT IDE Demo Recording Script - Final

**Target:** 45-60 second MP4 showcasing JAT's multi-project orchestration
**Key Message:** Manage multiple client projects simultaneously with one IDE

---

## DEMO PROJECTS SETUP

Three realistic, independent projects:

# Show only demo projects in IDE
jat-demo on
```

### 2. Start IDE

```bash
jat

## 🔧 TECHNICAL SETUP

### Recording with OBS
- Canvas: 1440x900
- FPS: 30
- Bitrate: 6000 Kbps
- Format: MP4
- **Record longer than needed** (easier to cut than re-record)

### Video Editing (Post-Recording)

**OBS does NOT edit video.** Use one of these free editors:

**Recommended: DaVinci Resolve (Free)**
- Professional-grade, completely free
- Speed controls for fast-forward effects
- Text overlay capabilities
- Good export options

**Alternatives:**
- **OpenShot** - Simple, quick cuts and speed changes
- **Kdenlive** - Linux-native, full-featured
- **Shotcut** - Cross-platform, decent for basic edits

### Editing Plan
1. Import raw recording
2. **Cut:** Remove dead space, mistakes, waiting
3. **Speed up:** Agent working sections → 1.5-2x speed
4. **Keep normal:** User interactions, modal appearances
5. **Add:** Text overlays for key moments
6. **Export:** Final MP4 (~45-55 seconds)

---

## 🚨 CONTINGENCY PLANS

### If agent doesn't ask for input:
- Still impressive with 3 parallel agents
- Focus on project organization features

### If tasks don't create properly:
- Have backup `.beads/issues.jsonl` ready
- Can manually create tasks quickly

### If recording runs long:
- Cut the feature tour (Scene 8)
- Speed up middle sections more

---

## ✅ SUCCESS METRICS

The demo succeeds if viewers understand:

1. **Multi-project management** - Not just one codebase
2. **Parallel execution** - Real simultaneous work
3. **Interactive orchestration** - IDE handles agent questions
4. **Flexible organization** - Collapse/expand/monitor as needed
5. **Complete workflow** - From task creation to completion

---

## 🎬 FINAL STEPS

1. **Record:** Save as `~/code/jat/assets/dashboard-demo-raw.mp4`
2. **Edit:** Trim, speed up working sections, add text overlays
3. **Export:** Final version as `dashboard-demo.mp4`
4. **Upload:** To GitHub, get shareable URL
5. **Update README:** Add video link with compelling description

---

## After Recording

```bash
# Restore normal projects
jat-demo off

# Clean up demo projects (optional - with confirmation prompt)
jat-demo clean
```
