{"id":"jat-jopd","title":"Fix duplicate agent creation when dashboard spawns task","description":"When launching a task from the dashboard, two agents are created instead of one.\n\n**Problem:**\n1. Spawn endpoint creates agent (e.g., DullHill) via am-register\n2. Spawn assigns task to that agent via bd update\n3. Spawn sends /jat:start task-id to Claude (without agent name)\n4. /jat:start sees task-id, creates NEW agent (e.g., DullStream)\n5. Result: Two agents, task reassigned to wrong one\n\n**Root Cause:**\nIn /jat:start STEP 1C, there's no handling for PARAM_TYPE=task-id. It falls through to 'no agent registered' and creates a new agent, ignoring that the task already has an assignee.\n\n**Fix:**\nAdd check in STEP 1C of commands/jat/start.md:\n\n```\nIf PARAM_TYPE == 'task-id':\n  1. Check task assignee: bd show $TASK_ID --json | jq '.[0].assignee'\n  2. If assignee exists AND is in am-agents:\n     → REUSE that agent (skip am-register)\n     → Write assignee to .claude/agent-{session_id}.txt\n  3. If no assignee OR assignee not in am-agents:\n     → Create new agent as usual\n```\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- commands/jat/start.md (STEP 1C section)\n\n**Testing:**\n1. Kill existing tmux sessions\n2. Click Launch on a task from dashboard\n3. Verify only ONE agent is created\n4. Verify agent name matches spawn-created agent\n5.

Agent investigates, finds -p flag causes non-interactive mode, fixes cli/jat. No Beads task existed. Running /agent:complete should:\n1. Detect work signals: 'I fixed...', 'The fix...', 'Updated cli/jat'\n2. See git diff: cli/jat modified\n3. Propose: 'Fix jat CLI -p flag causing non-interactive sessions' (type: bug)\n4. User confirms → create task → complete normally\n\n**Implementation:**\nAdd Step 1D after Step 1C in complete.md:\n1. Analyze conversation for completed work signals (I added, I fixed, I implemented, etc.)\n2. Analyze git state (uncommitted changes, recent commits)\n3. Synthesize work summary (title, type, description)\n4. Present proposal to user for confirmation\n5.
