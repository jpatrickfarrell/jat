# Example 4: Conflict Resolution

# Pattern: Handling file reservation conflicts gracefully
#
# Scenario:
#   - Bob tries to reserve files already held by Alice
#   - Conflict detected automatically
#   - Bob coordinates with Alice to work on different part
#   - Both agents work productively
#
# Key concepts:
#   - Automatic conflict detection
#   - Coordination via messages
#   - Shared locks (when appropriate)
#   - Working on different parts simultaneously

Hi Alice,

I need to add tests for the auth flow but you have src/auth/** reserved.

**My task:** Add integration tests for auth
**Your task:** Refactoring auth flow

**Suggested approach:**
1. I can write tests against the OLD auth flow first (doesn't touch src/auth/**)
2. When you're done refactoring, I'll update tests for the new flow
3. OR: I can work on a different task and come back later

What works best for your timeline?

Good coordination, Bob!

My auth refactor will take about 1 more hour. Here's a better approach:

**Immediate option:**
- You can read auth files (no reservation needed for reading)
- Write tests in tests/auth/** (different pattern, no conflict!)
- I'll notify you when refactor is done

**After my refactor:**
- I'll release src/auth/**
- You update tests to match new auth flow
- We both win!

Does that work?
