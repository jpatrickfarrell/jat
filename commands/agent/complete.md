Complete current task properly with full verification, then show menu of available tasks and recommend next task.

# Agent Complete - Finish Task Properly

**Usage:**
- `/agent:complete` - Complete current task with full verification, show menu

**What this command does:**
1. **Read & Respond to Agent Mail** (ALWAYS - before completing)
2. **Full Completion Protocol**:
   - Verify task (tests, lint, security, browser checks)
   - Commit changes with proper message
3. **Beads Task Management**:
   - Mark task as complete in Beads (`bd close`)
   - Release file reservations
4. **Announce Completion** in Agent Mail
5. **Next Task Selection**:
   - Show available tasks menu
   - Display recommended next task with one-line command
   - Wait for user to choose (does NOT auto-start)

**Key behaviors:**
- **ALWAYS check Agent Mail first** - before completing work
- Mail = read + respond + ack (not just silent batch-ack)

**When to use:**
- After you display "🔍 READY FOR REVIEW" and user approves
- **Careful workflow**: You want to choose next task manually
- **Context switch**: Might want different type of work next
- **Review point**: Want to check status before continuing
- **End of work**: Last task before closing terminal

**When NOT to use:**
- Want to keep going automatically → use `/agent:next` instead
- Need to pivot quickly → use `/agent:pause` instead

## CRITICAL: "Ready for Review" vs "Complete"

**These are two different states. Never confuse them.**

| State | Meaning | Display | Beads Status |
|-------|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Ready for Review** | Code work done, awaiting user decision | "🔍 READY FOR REVIEW" | `in_progress` |
| **Complete** | Closed in Beads, reservations released | "✅ TASK COMPLETE" | `closed` |

**NEVER say "Task Complete" until AFTER:**
1. Changes committed
2. `bd close` has run successfully
3. Reservations released
4. Completion announced via Agent Mail

**The typical flow:**
1. You finish coding → display "🔍 READY FOR REVIEW"
2. User reviews and runs `/agent:complete`
3. You run completion steps (commit, close, release, announce)
4. THEN display "✅ TASK COMPLETE"

**Why this matters:**
- Other agents check Beads to see if tasks are available
- If you say "complete" but haven't run `bd close`, another agent will see the task as still in-progress
- This causes confusion and coordination problems

## Bash Syntax Patterns for Claude Code

**CRITICAL:** Claude Code's Bash tool escapes command substitution syntax. You MUST use these patterns:

### CORRECT Patterns

**Pattern 1: Use Read/Write tools (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
# Step 1: Get value
~/code/jat/scripts/get-current-session-id
# → "a019c84c-7b54-45cc-9eee-dd6a70dea1a3"

# Step 2: Use Write tool with that value
Write(.claude/agent-a019c84c-7b54-45cc-9eee-dd6a70dea1a3.txt, "AgentName")
```

**Pattern 2: Explicit variable assignment with semicolon**
```bash
# Works: Explicit assignment with semicolon
SESSION_ID="a019c84c-7b54-45cc-9eee-dd6a70dea1a3"; echo "$SESSION_ID"

# Works: Use test command with && / ||
test -f "$file" && echo "exists" || echo "not found"
```

### WRONG Patterns (Will Cause Syntax Errors)

```bash
# BROKEN: Command substitution in assignment
SESSION_ID=$(~/code/jat/scripts/get-current-session-id)
# Error: gets escaped

# BROKEN: if statement with &&
SESSION_ID="abc" && if [[ -f "$file" ]]; then echo "yes"; fi
# Error: syntax error
```

---

## Implementation Steps

### STEP 1: Get Current Task and Agent Identity

#### 1A: Get Session ID
```bash
~/code/jat/scripts/get-current-session-id
# → Extract session_id value
```

#### 1B: Get Agent Name
```bash
# Read .claude/agent-{session_id}.txt
# → Extract agent_name
```

#### 1C: Get Current Task
```bash
# Get task from Beads (in_progress tasks for this agent)
bd list --json | jq -r --arg agent "$agent_name" \
  '.[] | select(.assignee == $agent and .status == "in_progress") | .id' | head -1
```

**Error handling:**
- If no session ID found → error "No active session. Run /agent:start first"
- If no agent name found → error "No agent registered. Run /agent:start first"
- If no in_progress task → error "No task in progress. Run /agent:start to begin work"

---

### STEP 2: Read & Respond to Agent Mail (ALWAYS)

**THIS STEP IS MANDATORY - runs before any completion work.**

Do NOT silently batch-ack messages. Actually READ them and RESPOND if needed.

#### 2A: Check Inbox
```bash
am-inbox "$agent_name" --unread
```

#### 2B: Display Messages to User
Show the user what messages are in the inbox. Read each message.

#### 2C: Respond If Needed
- If a message asks a question → reply with `am-reply`
- If a message changes requirements → adjust your plan
- If a message says "stop" or "wait" → pause and clarify
- If a message is informational → acknowledge it

#### 2D: Acknowledge Messages
```bash
# Only AFTER reading and responding
am-inbox "$agent_name" --unread --json | jq -r '.[].id' | while read msg_id; do
  am-ack "$msg_id" --agent "$agent_name"
done
```

**Why this matters:**
- Messages might say "don't complete yet, found a bug"
- Messages might say "requirements changed"
- Messages might say "I need to review first"
- You need context BEFORE completing work

---

### STEP 3: Verify Task

```bash
echo "Verifying task before completion..."

# Run verification checks:
# - Tests
# - Lint
# - Security scan
# - Browser checks (if applicable)

# If verification fails, STOP and report issues
# Do NOT continue to completion
```

---

### STEP 4: Commit Changes

```bash
echo "Committing changes..."

# Get task details for commit message
task_json=$(bd show "$task_id" --json)
task_title=$(echo "$task_json" | jq -r '.[0].title')
task_type=$(echo "$task_json" | jq -r '.[0].issue_type')

# Check git status
git_status=$(git status --porcelain)

if [[ -n "$git_status" ]]; then
  git add .
  git commit -m "$(cat <<EOF
$task_type: $task_title

Task: $task_id

EOF
)"
else
  echo "No changes to commit"
fi
```

---

### STEP 5: Mark Task Complete in Beads

```bash
bd close "$task_id" --reason "Completed by $agent_name"
```

---

### STEP 6: Release File Reservations

```bash
# Release all file reservations for this agent
am-reservations --agent "$agent_name" --json | jq -r '.[].path_pattern' | while read pattern; do
  am-release "$pattern" --agent "$agent_name"
done
```

---

### STEP 7: Announce Completion

```bash
am-send "[$task_id] Completed: $task_title" \
  "Task completed by $agent_name.

Status: Complete
Type: $task_type
Verification: Full (tests, lint, security)

Agent is now available for next task." \
  --from "$agent_name" \
  --to @active \
  --thread "$task_id"
```

---

### STEP 8: Show Final Summary + Available Tasks Menu

```bash
echo ""
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "✅ Task Completed: $task_id \"$task_title\""
echo "👤 Agent: $agent_name"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""

# Get available tasks
bd ready --json

# Display recommended next task (highest priority)
# Display full task menu
# Show next steps
```

---

## Quick Mode Behavior

**This command does NOT have a quick mode.**

For quick completion without verification, use `/agent:next quick` instead.

**Still done (NEVER skip these):**
- STEP 2: Read & respond to Agent Mail
- All other steps

---

## Output Example

**Successful completion:**
```

## Key Design Principles

1. **Always check Agent Mail first**
   - Read messages BEFORE completing work
   - Respond to questions, don't just ack
   - Context matters for decision-making

2. **Full verification required**
   - No quick mode for this command
   - Use `/agent:next quick` if you need speed

3. **Show menu, don't auto-start**
   - User chooses next task
   - Recommend highest priority
   - Different from `/agent:next` which auto-continues
